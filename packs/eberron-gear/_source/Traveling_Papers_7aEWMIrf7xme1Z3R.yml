  description: >-
    <p>Anyone who travels across national borders is usually required to carry
    traveling papers identifying them, their residence, their destination, and
    their reason for travel. Traveling papers consist of a parchment sheet with
    the appropriate information and an arcane mark, carried in a leather folder.
    House Sivis, House Orien, House Deneith, and House Lyrandar all offer
    traveling papers that are recognized throughout central Khorvaire.</p>
