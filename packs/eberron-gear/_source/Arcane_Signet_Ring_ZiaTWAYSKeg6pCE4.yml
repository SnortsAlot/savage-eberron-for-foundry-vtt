    <p>Dragonmarked houses use these rings for identification purposes. These
    rings are set with large gemstones that contain an intricate runic
    pattern—actually an arcane mark—that becomes visible when worn by the person
    for whom it was constructed. It is extremely unusual for anyone who does not
    have the Aristocrat Edge as a member of a dragonmarked house to wear an
    arcane signet ring.</p>
