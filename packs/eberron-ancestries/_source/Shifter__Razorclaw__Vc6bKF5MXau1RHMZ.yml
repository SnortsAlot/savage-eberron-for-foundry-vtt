    <ul><li><p><strong>Keen Senses (+1):</strong> Shifters begin with a d6
    Notice skill. The skill’s maximum increases to
    d12+1.</p></li><li><p><strong>Low Light Vision (+1):</strong> Shifters
    ignore penalties for Dim and Dark Illumination (but not Pitch
    Darkness).</p></li><li><p><strong>Shifting (+2):</strong> This ability
    allows a shifter to tap into his lycanthropic heritage. At character
    creation, the player chooses a shifter ability from the list below. Shifting
    is a limited free action and lasts up to 5 rounds plus 1 round for each
    Shifter Edge they have. The shifter can shift back to his normal form at any
    time before then. While in this animal-like form, the shifter can ignore 1
    Wound penalty. When the shifting ends, the shifter takes a level of Fatigue.
    This level of Fatigue can only be removed after 4 hours of abstaining from
    shifting.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Beasthide:</strong> The skin of beasthide
    shifters harden, providing Armor

    cliffwalk shifters become stronger. They gain the Free Runner
    Edge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Longstride:</strong> The legs of longstride

    Edge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Longtooth:</strong> The face of a longtooth
    shifter distorts, growing a canine muzzle full of sharp teeth that cause
