  description: >-
    <p>As an action, changelings can alter physical features to appear as
    another humanoid form up to one Size larger or smaller but cannot alter
    their clothing or gear. This ability does not have a limited duration. The
    change of appearance grants changelings a +4 to Performance rolls when
    attempting to impersonate another individual they've observed. If killed,
    they automatically return to their natural form.</p>
