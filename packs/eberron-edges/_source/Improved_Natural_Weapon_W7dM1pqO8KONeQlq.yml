    <p>This adventurerâ€™s Natural Weapon is deadlier than usual. Its damage die
    increases by one die type.</p><p>This Edge counts as a Shifter Edge. If the
    Shifter also has Extra Shifter Ability and multiple Natural Weapons as a
    result, this Edge can be taken multiple times, once for each type of Natural
    Weapon.</p><p></p>
