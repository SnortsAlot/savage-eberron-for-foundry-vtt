  description: >-
    <p>Some occultists have expanded their knowledge beyond the supernatural
    elements of the Material Plane. These adventurers have either experienced
    the effects of or have studied the other planes of existence that influence
    the world. Adventurers with this Edge may make Occult rolls to identify the
    effects, properties, and inhabitants of any of the other 13 planes. They may
    also use the Occult skill in place of Survival rolls while navigating
    through a manifest zone or any plane other than their own.</p>
