  description: >-
    <p>It is said that some individuals have enough charisma to charm the dead,
    and for some, it’s literally true. The adventurer can make Persuasion rolls
    to influence the attitude of mindless undead. Due to the mindless nature of
    the undead creature, the Persuasion roll has the ability to shift the
    creature’s attitude one level per raise.</p>
