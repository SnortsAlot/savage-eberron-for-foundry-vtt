  description: >-
    <p>As a limited free action, a soulknife can manifest a blade made of pure
    semisolid, psychic energy. The
    @UUID[Compendium.savage-eberron.eberron-abilities.Item.yb8j3gDo0vzaNsPm]{mind
    blade} is about the size of a short sword and does Str+d6 damage and is
    considered a magic weapon for purposes of exploiting weaknesses. The nature
    of the mind blade reduces the minimum Strength requirement of the weapon by
    one die type. It has Hardness 10 and can be sundered. If destroyed, the mind
    blade dissipates, and the soulknife may form a new mind blade on their next
    turn.</p><p>Mind blades are susceptible to
    <em>@UUID[Compendium.swade-fantasy-companion.swade-fc-powers.Item.aqzVQ4fRrk7OYqgx]{dispel}</em>
    or other sources that might nullify psionic effects.</p>
