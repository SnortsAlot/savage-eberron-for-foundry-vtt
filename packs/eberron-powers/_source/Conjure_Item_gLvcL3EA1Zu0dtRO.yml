    <article><p>The caster can create an object weighing up to one pound for
    every 2 Power Points spent. The item must be a simple, mundane object made
    of a common material (GM's call) such as a 10-foot pole, blanket, shield,
    etc. A raise on the arcane skill roll produces a more durable version of the
    conjured item.</p><p>Conjured items appear in the hands of the caster or on
    the ground nearby. Once the Duration expires, the item fades from reality.
    This can cause issues, for example, if the conjured item holds a door open
    or was given as a
    gift.</p><div><p><strong>Modifiers</strong></p></div><ul><li><strong>Complete
    (+1):</strong> The object is a complete set, such as a chess set or a quiver
    of arrows. The set must fit under the weight limit.</li><li><strong>Create
    Food and Water (Special):</strong> Instead of an object, every 1 Power Point
    creates enough food and water to sustain a Size 0 humanoid for one day. The
    nourishing food is permanent (doesn't disappear after you eat it), though it
    decays and is inedible after 24 hours if not consumed. The water is just
    like clean rainwater and does not spoil.</li><li><strong>Enduring (+1 per
    pound):</strong> The object's Duration becomes “permanent” until dispelled.
    The Power Points are “invested” and unavailable until it's destroyed,
    dispelled, or dismissed by the caster. The conjurer may dismiss the object
    at any time, regardless of sight, distance, or other factors. His Power
    Points then begin recharging normally.</li><li
    class="savage-eberron--epic-modifier"><strong>Major Creation [+5]:</strong>
    The item is crafted from a special material such as adamantine, bronzewood,
    byeshk, etc.</li><li class="savage-eberron--epic-modifier"><strong>True
    Creation [+10]:</strong> When used with the Durable modifier, the object is
    created with matter displaced from another location on the material plane.
    Because it is composed of native material, it is regarded as very real in
    every way and cannot be dispelled or dismissed. Although the item is
    permanent, Power Points are not permanently invested.</li></ul></article>
