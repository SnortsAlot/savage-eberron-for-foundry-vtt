    <article><p><em>Scrying</em> allows the caster to spy on a distant target.
    Preparing the spell takes one uninterrupted minute while the caster focuses
    on a target item, creature, or location. This makes her Vulnerable and
    unable to take any other actions. If she's Shaken or Stunned during this
    time, the spell fails.</p><p>If the caster has never seen the target
    herself, she makes her arcane skill roll at -2. <em>Scrying</em> on a target
    in a different plane of existence also imposes a -2
    penalty.</p><p><em>Scrying</em> is opposed by the subject's Spirit. If the
    target wins, he knows he's being spied on. If the caster wins, he can see
    and hear the target and the area around it but cannot move his perspective.
    With a raise, he can shift perspective and follow the target at a Pace
    24.</p><p>A <em>scrying</em> “eye” may be seen with
    <em>@UUID[Compendium.swade-fantasy-companion.swade-fc-powers.Item.sXrRk20IIFPhxkC0]{detect
    arcana}</em> (but not detect magic). It may also be
    <em>@UUID[Compendium.swade-fantasy-companion.swade-fc-powers.Item.aqzVQ4fRrk7OYqgx]{dispelled}
    </em>(at -2 if suspected but not
    revealed).</p><div><p><strong>Modifiers</strong></p></div><ul><li
    class="savage-eberron--epic-modifier"><strong>Greater Scrying (+5):</strong>
    The following powers function reliably through the scrying “eye:”
