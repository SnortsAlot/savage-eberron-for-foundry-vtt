    <article><p><em>Teleport</em> allows a character to disappear and instantly
    reappear up to 12″ (24 yards) distant, or double that with a
    raise.</p><p>Opponents adjacent to a character who teleports away don't get
    a free attack (see
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.JournalEntry.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03withdrawingf00]{Withdrawing
    from Melee} in
    <em>@UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.JournalEntry.swadecor00introd.JournalEntryPage.00introduction00]{Savage
    Worlds}</em>).</p><p>If casting <em>teleport</em> on willing subjects, the
    caster decides where they move to, not the
    targets.</p><div><p><strong>Modifiers</strong></p></div><ul><li><strong>Additional
    Recipients (+1):</strong> The power may affect more than one target for 1
    additional Power Point each.</li><li
    class="savage-eberron--epic-modifier"><strong>Gate (+5):</strong> Instead of
    teleporting, the caster opens a temporary portal connecting her current
    location and the destination. Creatures and objects can travel through this
    gate from either side for 5 rounds.</li><li
    class="savage-eberron--epic-modifier"><p><strong>Greater Teleport
    (+5):</strong> The character can teleport much farther. The caster must
    concentrate on her destination for at least one round, taking no other
    actions. This makes her Vulnerable; if Shaken or Stunned, the spell
    fails.</p><p>For one round of concentration, the character can teleport up
    to 100 miles. For two rounds, she can travel 1000 miles, and with three
    rounds, she can go anywhere in the world.</p><p>If the caster has physically
    been to the desired location previously, there is no penalty to her roll.
    With success she arrives within 2d6 × 10 feet of her target, or on target
    with a raise.</p><p>If the caster has a detailed map or has seen it through
    a power or device, she suffers -2 to the roll. With success, she arrives
    within 2d6 × 100 feet, or on target with a raise.</p><p>If the caster has a
    crude map or a general notion of the place on a regional or world map, she
    suffers a -4. She arrives within 2d10 miles with success, or within 2d6 ×
    100 feet with a raise.</p><p>In the absence of such information, teleporting
    is not possible.</p><p>A
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.JournalEntry.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03rules000000000]{Critical
    Failure} transports the recipient to a random location (GM's call) on the
    same plane of existence.</p></li><li><strong>Teleport Foe (+2):</strong>
    Foes may be targeted at a Range of Touch. The foe resists the casting with
    an opposed Spirit roll against the arcane skill total and is sent up to 12″
    away with success and 24″ with a raise. Foes may not be teleported into
    solid objects.</li><li class="savage-eberron--epic-modifier"><strong>Refuge
    (+5):</strong> The caster creates a token that she willingly gifts to
    another. Upon triggering with a command word, the item will either
    <em>teleport</em> the possessor and everything he is carrying to the
    caster’s abode or <em>teleport</em> the caster within 2” of the possessor of
    the object; the caster chooses which upon creation of the token. The Power
    Points used to create the token are transferred to the token and remain with
    it until the token is activated,
    <em>@UUID[Compendium.swade-fantasy-companion.swade-fc-powers.Item.aqzVQ4fRrk7OYqgx]{dispelled}</em>,
    or the power is dismissed by the caster, at which point the Power Points
    recharge as usual.</li></ul></article>
