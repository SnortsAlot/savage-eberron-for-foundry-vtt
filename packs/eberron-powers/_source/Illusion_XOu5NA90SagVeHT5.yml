    <article><p>One of the greatest powers is the ability to create something
    from nothing-even if it's not real!</p><p><em>Illusion</em> can be used to
    create a visual scene or replica of most anything the caster can imagine,
    but it is silent, intangible, and incapable of affecting the real world. For
    example, illusionary weapons pass through foes, one cannot sit in an
    illusionary chair, and an illusionary dog has no audible bark.</p><p>Those
    who contact an <em>illusion</em> or doubt it's real make a Smarts roll as a
    free action (at -2 if the power was activated with a raise). If successful,
    that individual is no longer subject to this casting.</p><p>The GM should
    make group rolls for Extras as they point out the <em>illusion's</em>
    inconsistencies to each other.</p><p>The volume of the <em>illusion</em>
    must fit within a sphere the size of a Medium Blast Template (4″ or eight
    yards in
    diameter).</p><div><p><strong>Modifiers</strong></p></div><ul><li><strong>Area
    of Effect (+1):</strong> The illusion's area of effect is increased to the
    size of a Large Blast Template.</li><li><p><strong>Deadly Illusion
    (+3):</strong> The illusion may attack or otherwise cause harm. The caster
    may use her actions to make the illusion to “attack” an individual. This is
    an opposed roll of the caster's arcane skill versus the target's Smarts (at
    -2 if the power was activated with a raise).</p><p>If the caster wins, the
    target is Shaken (this cannot cause Incapacitation). With a raise, the
    target suffers a Wound (this <em>can</em> cause Incapacitation). The caster
    may attack additional foes as Multi-Actions. She may not use other combat
    maneuvers, such as Called Shots or Wild Attacks (though it may look that
    way!)</p></li><li class="savage-eberron--epic-modifier"><strong>Duration
    (+2):</strong> The Duration is measured in minutes.</li><li><strong>Mobility
    (+1/+2):</strong> For +1 Power Point, the illusion can move (and fly) at a
    Pace of 12, or 24 for +2 Power Points. This is a limited free
    action.</li><li class="savage-eberron--epic-modifier"><strong>Permanent
    (+3):</strong> The illusion is permanent but can be revealed by speaking a
    secret word.</li><li><strong>Sound (+1):</strong> The power generates sound
    appropriate to the <em>illusion</em>. Illusionary allies may talk,
    illusionary crows caw, and so on. It may not mask or mute existing sound,
    however.</li><li><strong>Strong (+2):</strong> Smarts rolls to disbelieve
    the <em>illusion</em> are made at -2.</li></ul></article>
