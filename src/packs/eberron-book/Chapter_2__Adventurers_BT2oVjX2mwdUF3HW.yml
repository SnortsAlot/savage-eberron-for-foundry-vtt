  content: "<article id=\"chapter-two-adventurers\" class=\"savage-eberron --article\"><p>In the world of <cite>Eberron</cite>, characters are known as adventurers, and the Game Master has the title of Prophesier.</p><p>Before you get started creating your adventurer, you’ll want to download a copy of the <cite>Eberron for Savage Worlds</cite>\_character sheet from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://immaterialplane.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1691623482354526&amp;usg=AOvVaw3rWV8E6yKWGJARvcJz4ZXI\">immaterialplane.com</a>.</p><section><h2>Concept</h2><p><cite>Eberron</cite>\_is filled with a wide range of roles and professions. You can choose to play a ranger who knows how to survive in the wild, a wizard who studies the very magic that permeates this world, an artificer who can infuse that magic into tools and weapons, or any other role you can conceive using the rules below.</p></section><section><h2>Ancestry</h2><p>This book includes 11 ancestries from which your adventurer could be a descendant. Each has unique abilities inherent to them.</p></section><section><h2>Hindrances</h2><p>Your adventurer might have flaws that impede achieving their goals and objectives, but heroes often do great things despite—and sometimes because of—their flaws. Hindrances represent those flaws be they physical disabilities, troublesome personality traits, or dark secrets your adventurer might be hiding.</p><p>You can take up to 4 points of Hindrances.</p><p>A Major Hindrance is worth 2 points, and a Minor is worth 1. An adventurer could thus take two Major Hindrances, four Minor, or any combination that adds up to 4 points. (You can take more Hindrances if you want, but the maximum benefit is 4 points!)</p><p>Taking Hindrances not only helps you define your adventurer but also gives you additional points you can use to start with additional attributes or skill points, Edges, or even money for gear.</p><p>For 2 points you can:</p><ul><li>Raise an attribute one die type, or</li><li>Choose an Edge</li></ul><p>For 1 point you can:</p><ul><li>Gain another skill point.</li><li>Start play with an additional 500 gold pieces.</li></ul></section><section><h2>Traits</h2><p>Characters are defined by attributes and skills, collectively called “Traits,” and both work in exactly the same way. Attributes and skills are ranked by die types, typically from d4 to d12, with d6 being the average for adult humans. Higher is better!</p><section><h3>Attributes</h3><p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor (discussed in more detail in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>).</p><p>You then have 5 points to increase your attributes. Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point. You’re free to spend these points however you like, except that no attribute may ever be raised above a d12. If an Edge or power increases the attribute beyond d12, each increase adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps, for example, is a Strength score of d12 + 2.</p></section><section><h3>Skills</h3><p>Skills are learned abilities such as firing weapons, hand-to-hand combat, arcane knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on. Skills in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>\_are very broad to keep the action simple and straightforward. The Shooting skill, for example, covers bows, crossbows, wands, and other ranged weapons.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Core Skills:</span>\_Athletics, Common Knowledge, Notice, Persuasion, and Stealth are “innate” abilities most adult adventurers have. Your adventurer starts with a d4 in each of these core skills.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Buying Skills:</span>\_After core skills are assigned, you have 15 additional points to raise core skills or buy and raise new skills as you see fit.</p><p>Each die type costs 1 point (starting at d4) as long as the skill is equal to or less than the attribute to which it’s linked to (listed beside the skill in parentheses). If you exceed the linked attribute, the cost becomes 2 points per die type.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Skill Maximums:</span>\_Skills may not be increased above d12 during character creation unless the character starts with the skill at d6. If the skill starts with a d6, increase her maximum to d12 + 1. A wizard might start with a d6 in spellcasting, for example, which means that skill may be increased to d12 + 1.</p></section></section><section><h2>Derived Statistics</h2><p>Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need to fill in, described below.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Pace</span>\_is how fast your adventurer moves in tactical situations like combat. Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards in the real world. Movement is explained in detail in the <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>\_core rules.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Parry</span>\_is equal to 2 plus half your character’s Fighting die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn’t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the Target Number (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12 + 1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12 + 1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12 + 2 results in a Parry of 9.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Size:</span>\_A hero’s default Size is 0 unless altered by racial abilities, Edges, or Hindrances. It cannot be less than −1 or more than +3.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Toughness</span>\_is your adventurer’s damage threshold. Damage rolls that equal or exceed this number cause harm (see Damage in the Savage Worlds core rules).</p><p>Toughness is 2 plus half your adventurer’s Vigor, plus Armor (use the armor worn on his torso). Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like Parry, above.</p></section><section><h2>Edges</h2><p>Attributes and skills are an adventurer’s basic statistics, but what really makes individuals different are their Edges. One might focus on Leadership Edges that lets him rally his fellow soldiers while another concentrates on taking out large numbers of foes at once with Sweep or Frenzy.</p><p>Who your adventurer was and what role they served previously in their life (likely during the Last War) shapes who they are now and who they might become. All adventurers start with a free Background or Professional Edge that reflects the character’s previous life. They may gain additional Edges by taking Hindrances or Advances once play begins. Any additional Edges taken during character creation could expand on that background or take them on a new path.</p><p>Available Edges can be found in this book, in the <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>\_core rules, and in the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>.</p></section><section><h2>Gear</h2><p>Adventurers begin play with gear and weapons appropriate for their skills and background. This includes appropriate clothing for extreme temperatures, equipment such as rope or climbing gear, or tools used for specific skills such as Thievery. For example, if you’re playing a veteran of the Last War, your adventurer might still possess the armor and weapons issued to them during the war. The Prophesier has the final say in determining whether your list of gear is appropriate.</p></section><section><h2>Background Details</h2><p>Your character became an adventurer for a reason. Think about what impact the Last War had on their lives. If they’re of an ancestry with a longer life span, how long have they lived through the war? If they’re part of an organization, why and how did they come to be so? If they’re no longer a member of a particular organization, why not?</p><p>Additionally, players are strongly encouraged to discuss with each other what binds their adventurers together.</p></section><section><h2>Ancestries</h2><p>The ancestries presented below are balanced to 4 points of positive abilities.</p><section><h3>Changeling</h3><ul><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Change Appearance (+3):</span>\_As an action, changelings can alter physical features to appear as another humanoid form up to one Size larger or smaller but cannot alter their clothing or gear.

Creating an item requires appropriate raw materials costing half the item’s market value and appropriate tools. Making something is usually resolved as an extended skill check, with each skill roll representing roughly a day’s work, though this may be smaller for particularly simple jobs.</p><p>The number of successes required and modifiers depend on the complexity, size, and cost of the item to be created, as well as the availability of necessary resources and tools, as determined by the Prophesier. A critical failure on a skill roll means the work has been ruined and the raw materials wasted.</p></section><section><h3>Driving (Agility)</h3><p>Driving enables House Orien heirs with the Mark of Passage to control a lightning rail or elemental land cart. Because the bound elemental handles the majority of the propulsion, Driving typically is only needed in dangerous situations.</p></section><section><h3>Imbuing (Smarts)</h3><p>This is the skill artificers use to embed magical infusions into an object or construct (see Artificer in Arcana).</p></section><section><h3>Language (Smarts)</h3><p>The world of Eberron features many cultures and races. Use the Multiple Languages Setting Rule as presented in Savage Worlds to determine how many skills an adventurer knows at the start of play.

Additionally, with the exception of the prohibited Edges below, all Edges listed in the <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>\_core rules and the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>\_are available for use in an <cite>Eberron</cite>\_campaign.</p><p>All adventurers begin play with one free Background or Professional Edge.</p><p>The following Edges from the <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>\_core rules are disallowed: Double Tap, Gadgeteer, McGyver, Rapid Fire, Rock and Roll!, Two-Gun Kid, Wizard.</p><aside><h2>Classes</h2><p><cite>Eberron</cite>\_was originally designed for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, which utilizes \"classes\" to express character concepts and features, and it introduced a new class of its own, the Artificer. The options presented below will help you create a character that expresses the same concept as that class.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Artificer:</span>\_Take Repair, Thievery, Crafting, and Arcane Background (Artificer), which is included in this book. Taking the Artificer Edge at Seasoned will allow you to craft arcane devices and permanent magical items. At Veteran, take Master Artificer if you want to craft permanent magical items more efficiently. If you'd like to create a small construct servant to imbue with infusions, take the Homunculus Edge. Trap Sense gives the Artificer the ability to detect the hidden workings of a trap and disarm it using his expertise.</p><p>For lists of character options to emulate other classes that are more traditional, refer to the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>.</p></aside><section><h3>Background Edges</h3><section><h4>Aberrant Mark</h4><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Requirements:</span>\_Novice, any ancestry of a dragonmarked lineage</p><p>The adventurer bears an aberrant dragonmark, descended from mixed (or “corrupted”) bloodlines of two or more dragonmarked lineages.</p><p>Characters with this Edge either have the Outsider (Minor) Hindrance if the mark is visible or known or the Secret (Minor) Hindrance if the mark is hidden and unknown. They do not gain additional points for Traits and Edges from the Hindrance.</p><p>The dragonmark grants a single power granted by the mark regardless of its Rank requirement. The aberrant mark also grants a +1 bonus to Intimidation rolls against anyone who sees or knows of the bearer’s aberrant mark and doesn’t bear an aberrant mark of their own.</p><p>An aberrant mark doesn’t grant access to Edges that require an Arcane Background except for the Power Points and Soul Drain Edges. If the adventurer also has an Arcane Background, none of its Edges or abilities can be used with the dragonmark powers and vice versa.</p><p>The adventurer has 15 Power Points—dedicated to the use of their mark—that recharge normally. As a limited free action, the adventurer automatically activates the power with success for its regular cost. For 2 additional Power Points, the power can be activated with a raise. He may use applicable Power Modifiers if desired (at the usual cost).</p><p>Each time the adventurer selects the Power Points Edge for their aberrant mark, her mark changes into a larger, more complex pattern and increases in power.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Powers:</span> <em>Blast, blind, bolt, lower Trait, burrow </em>(self only)<em>, burst, confusion, curse, damage field </em>(self only)<em>, drain Power Points, elemental manipulation </em>(fire only)<em>, entangle, fear, havoc, mind wipe, puppet, slow, smite, stun, summon ally, summon demon, telekinesis, zombie.</em></p></section><section><h4>Adamantine Body</h4><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Requirements:</span>\_Novice, Warforged.</p><p>The warforged was created from a specially designed line made with adamantine.

Refer to <strong>Arcane Backgrounds</strong>\_in the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>\_for more details on taking multiple Arcane Backgrounds.</p></section><section><h4>Berserk Luck</h4><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Requirements:</span> Novice, Wild Card, Berserk</p><p>When going Berserk, the adventurer has a greater ability to alter her luck than most others do. This Edge grants 1 temporary Benny while going Berserk. If the adventurer doesn’t use this Benny while going Berserk, it disappears when it ends.</p></section><section><h4>Chronepsis’ Child</h4><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Requirements:</span>\_Novice, Wild Card</p><p>An adventurer with this Edge is said to be an influential part of the draconic Prophecy and under the watchful eye of Chronepsis, the dragon deity of fate, death, and judgement. This Edge is a renamed version of Destiny’s Child included with the <em>Savage Worlds Adventure Deck</em>.</p></section><section><h4>Dragon Totem</h4><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Requirements:</span>\_Novice, Region of origin Argonnessen or Seren, Fighting d4+</p><p>Some members of the barbarian tribes of Argonnessen and Seren claim one of the true dragon types as a spiritual totem. This may take the form of a patron or protector, or it might be a general source of strength. A Dragon Totem grants the adventurer Environmental Resistance based on the type of dragon as indicated on the table below. The Environmental Resistance grants a +4 bonus to resist matching Hazards or powers, and damage from such a source is reduced by 4.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Dragon</th><th>Energy Types</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Black</td><td>Acid</td></tr><tr><td>Blue</td><td>Electricity</td></tr><tr><td>Brass</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td>Bronze</td><td>Electricity</td></tr><tr><td>Copper</td><td>Acid</td></tr><tr><td>Gold</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td>Green</td><td>Acid</td></tr><tr><td>Red</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td>Silver</td><td>Cold</td></tr><tr><td>White</td><td>Cold</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h4 class=\"improved-edge\">Dragon Rage</h4><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Requirements:</span>\_Novice, Berserk or Frenzy, Dragon Totem, Fighting d8+</p><p>A true barbarian hailing from Argonnessen or Seren can call upon their Dragon Totem to grant them protection when going Berserk.
