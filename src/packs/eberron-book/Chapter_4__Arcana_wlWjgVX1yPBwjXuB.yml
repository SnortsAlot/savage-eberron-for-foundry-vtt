The mind blade is about the size of a short sword and does Str+d6 damage and is considered a magic weapon for purposes of exploiting weaknesses. The nature of the mind blade reduces the minimum Strength requirement of the weapon by one die type. It has Hardness 10 and can be sundered.

Mind blades are susceptible to <em>dispel</em>\_or other sources that might nullify psionic effects.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Throw Mind Blade:</span>\_A soulknife can throw his mind blade as a ranged weapon with an Athletics (throwing) roll.

The soulknife adds <em>lower Trait</em>\_(Smarts and Spirit only) to his list of known powers. The Range of the power is Touch only and delivered through his mind blade with a successful attack or touch attack. The soulknife benefits from these limitations as usual. Activating <em>lower Trait</em>\_on a mind blade is a limited free action.</p><p>The mind blade is then “charged” with the power until the next successful attack or touch attack. If the attack misses, the charge continues to hold for the remainder of the encounter or until it is dismissed.

If the wizard loses his spellbook, he can no longer cast powers if he has not recovered it by the next sunset or sunrise, whichever comes first.</p><p>After accessing his stored collection of notes, scrolls, tomes, and other arcane writings, a wizard may replace a lost spellbook with a week of work and 500 gp.</p></section></section></section></section><section><h2>Arcane Devices</h2><p>Creating an arcane device requires the Craft Magic Items Edge, which is simply the original Artificer Edge renamed.</p><section><h3>Using Dragonshards</h3><p>Attuned Eberron dragonshards can facilitate the creation of arcane devices by allowing the creator to imbue the device with Power Points without having to sacrifice her own. By grinding them into a powder to be infused into the materials, or by embedding them into a “socket” directly onto the item, the dragonshard can provide 1 Power Point per 100 gp of its value. The dragonshards can either be ground into a powder and infused into the materials and substances, or the crafter can embed the dragonshard directly onto the item. Once the dragonshard’s Power Points are spent, the shard becomes dull and brittle and might even crumble.</p></section></section><section><h2>Prepared Powers</h2><p>All Arcane Backgrounds except Artificer are able to use the rules for Prepared Powers as presented in the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>.</p><section><h3>Dragonshards in Ritual Magic</h3><p>The caster can pay the cost of performing a ritual with one or more dragonshards with a combined value of that cost. Most rituals use Eberron dragonshards, but the Prophesier might require an appropriate type such as Siberys dragonshards for enhancing psionic powers or Khyber dragonshards for binding entities.</p></section></section><section><h2>Spellcasting Services</h2><p>Magic is a massive industry in <cite>Eberron</cite>, and many of the Dragonmarked Houses and their guilds provide spellcasting services to those who can afford it.</p><p>The cost of these services is 25gp per Power Point. If the effect of a raise is required, the price is doubled. The increased cost for a raise accounts for the Power Points, components (or dragonshards), assistants making Support rolls to achieve the desired result, or multiple attempts to achieve the desired result. If the customer pays for a success only, and the caster’s arcane skill roll results in a raise regardless, the benefits of the raise come with no additional cost.</p><p>Professional casters have at least a d6 arcane skill. Casters with an arcane skill of d8 or higher are rare and in high demand. The cost of their spellcasting services is doubled for each increased die type.</p><section><h3>Rituals as a Service</h3><p>If the scope of a spellcasting service includes enhanced Effects achievable through Rituals, the cost of the service increases by 50% or 100% if a raise is required. The customer also typically provides or pays for the cost of the Eberron dragonshards used for the Ritual.</p></section></section><section><h2>Powers</h2><p>All powers listed in the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>\_are available.
