The cost of the shard is added to the market value of the item.</p></section></section><section><h3>Khyber Shard Items</h3><p>Khyber shard items bestow magic item qualities similarly to those listed in Enchantments at the beginning of this chapter.

Generally, docents are designed to advise and assist the warforged to which it is attached.</p><p>A warforged can only attach one docent. The warforged host can replace one docent with another, but the abilities of the new docent do not activate until 24 hours after the host has removed the previous docent.</p><p>As noted, docents have all of the same characteristics and properties as other intelligent items \_(see <strong>Intelligent Items</strong>\_below) but with the following additional features.</p><ul><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Mind Rider:</span>\_A docent maintains a telepathic link with the warforged to whom it is attached.

It reveals its powers when a warforged attaches it around the neck. When a warforged’s body becomes inert due to damage, the <em>torc</em>\_absorbs the warforged’s consciousness and repairs his injuries. The <em>circlet</em>\_repairs one Wound every 8 hours. When the first Wound is repaired, the warforged’s consciousness is transferred back.</p><p>The <em>circlet</em>\_can be removed while the warforged is inert. Removing the <em>circlet</em>\_prevents it from repairing the warforged. The <em>circlet</em>\_retains the warforged’s consciousness when removed. If another warforged attaches the <em>circlet</em>, the two warforged immediately make opposed Spirit rolls to gain control of the body. The loser’s consciousness is then trapped within the <em>circlet</em>. Similar to a battle of wills with an intelligent item, another opposed roll can be made once every 24 hours. The trapped consciousness effectively becomes a docent. As with a docent, a warforged may allow the trapped consciousness within the circlet to take over the body, but this switch may only occur once every 24 hours.</p><p>A <em>circlet of preservation</em>\_has a Hardness of 25, and it repairs its own Wounds at a rate of 1 Wound every hour.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Tauric Belt (attached component):</span>\_A <em>tauric belt</em>\_is made from woven mithral threads and dragonshard studs and has etchings of fantastic beasts.

The line of <em>conductor stones</em>\_on a given route repel against those covering the underside of a lightning rail car, keeping the cars afloat. The stones generate a field of visible electrical energy that arcs between adjacent stones and over the body of the coach.</p><p>Creative artificers and entrepreneurs have also designed alternative modes of transportation that run along <em>conductor stone</em>\_lines at high speeds. Unfortunately, they do not have the same weight of a lightning rail coach to counter the repulsion between stones, causing them to careen off the line when control is lost.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Orrery of the Planes:</span>\_Typically a little more than 1 foot in diameter, an <em>orrery of the planes</em>\_depicts Eberron, its twelve moons, and the Ring of Siberys. The <em>orrery</em>\_is forged from adamantine with tiny dragonshards embedded into its surfaces. It tracks the motion of the moons around Eberron and through its ring. The true power of the orrery is its connection to the planes of existence that surround the Material Plane.</p><p>Once per day, an owner of an <em>orrery of the planes</em>\_can create a localized manifest zone linked to a specific plane 10” (60 feet) in diameter.

Creating an eldritch machine requires no specific powers. The requirements for creating one are many, specific, and highly restrictive with respect to its construction, components, and location. The Prophesier should feel free to require whatever components deemed necessary. One of the most common key requirements is the construction taking place in the presence of a manifest zone. Materials and substances needed are often rare or even unique.</p><p>The process of constructing an eldritch machine should be a critical part of the campaign or adventure. Discovering the means to create one and assembling the components necessary could result in an adventure to multiple destinations such as the haunted ruins of Xen'drik or the Burning Keep in the Demon Wastes. It might even require the use of <em>mystic intervention</em>\_to gain assistance from a powerful extraplanar patron.</p><p>Operating an eldritch machine is no simple task. Activation usually requires the user has the Arcane Background Edge, appropriate skills such as Occult or an arcane skill, and familiarity with the machine's function. There is also a significant risk to using an eldritch machine as they are unstable. Testing the machine before operating it at full power is crucial, and the chance of a catastrophe is very real. Even if one were to come into possession of an eldritch machine, it might not even function properly or it could very well break or otherwise cease to function.</p><p>Eldritch machines are priceless, and the Prophesier should determine the costs of the components if such values are required.</p><p>In all cases, destroying an eldritch machine should be equally challenging, if not more so.</p><p>Below are several examples of eldritch machines villains or misguided individuals might create.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading --minor\">Emerald Reanimator:</span>\_All creatures that perish within 2 miles of this eldritch machine immediately animate as a zombie under the control of the device’s creator.

Finding such a location might take months or years of surveying. The construction also requires considerably large and pure uncut, unattuned Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber dragonshards which are bound to the location through rituals.

Such items are regarded as intelligent items and are treated as Wild Cards with a Wild Die and two Bennies. They also have three Wounds with regards to being sundered (see <strong>Breaking Things</strong>\_in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>).</p><p>Players and Prophesiers should think of intelligent items as characters, and not just as magic items that can think. For ease, the Prophesier should allow the player to run the intelligent item as another character they control. Yet, there are times when the intelligent item might decide to be uncooperative (see Battle of Wills below).</p><p>As intelligent items, they can be subjected to mind-affecting powers such as <em>mind reading</em>\_or <em>puppet</em>. They can also be the subject of Tests.</p><p>Use the tables below to determine the intelligent item’s Traits, personality, and goals.</p><section><h3>Traits</h3><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Attributes:</span>\_The Attributes column determines how many points an intelligent item has to distribute among Smarts and Spirit, both of which start at d4 and may go beyond a d12 (e.g., d12+1, d12+2, etc.).</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Skills:</span>\_The Skills column indicates how many skill points the intelligent item has. These are spent in the same way as for making regular adventurers, with one exception—skills may go over the linked attribute without paying double the cost. Intelligent items do not have any core skills.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Attribute Points</th><th>Skill Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1–3</td><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>4–8</td><td>2</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>9–13</td><td>3</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>14–16</td><td>4</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>17–18</td><td>6</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>8</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>10</td><td>20</td></tr></tbody></table><section><h4>Skills</h4><p>The Prophesier can either pick skills from the table or roll randomly. If rolling randomly, each additional time a skill is rolled after the first, it increases a die type. For example, the first time Taunt is rolled on the table, its die type is d4, increasing to d6, d8, and so on each time the skill is rolled again.</p><p>An intelligent item can use some of its skills directly, such as Occult or Persuasion, but others, such as Boating, Gambling, or Stealth, are likely used strictly for Support rolls (see <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>), giving its possessor advice based on its own knowledge.</p><p>The Prophesier has the final word on a when an intelligent item can and can’t assist its possessor.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Skill</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Academics</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Athletics</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Battle</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Boating</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Common Knowledge</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Driving/Piloting (choose one)</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Gambling</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Healing</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Intimidation</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Notice</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Occult</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Performance</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Persuasion</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Repair</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Research</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Riding</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Stealth</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Survival</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Taunt</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Thievery</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h4>Languages</h4><p>An intelligent item knows Common by default and knows a total number of Language skills equal to its Smarts die type. These languages are typically limited to those known by their creators. They may fill the remainder of their known languages immediately upon encountering them.</p></section></section><section><h3>Senses</h3><p>Intelligent items with the Notice skill can see and hear as if they were a biological creature. Those without the skill receive only vague impressions of what is going on around them—typically they can sense living creatures approaching within 1” (2 yards) but can’t make out specifics such as ancestry.</p><p>When donned or held, as appropriate to the item, it can see and hear everything the owner does. Intelligent items with Notice may use their own skill or that of their possessor.</p><p>Those without the Notice skill are totally reliant on their owner’s abilities—if a character has sensory-affecting Edges or Hindrances, then the item is also affected by them.</p></section><section><h3>Personality</h3><p>Intelligent items are more than just smart objects—they have distinct personalities, goals, drives, and feelings.</p><p>The prophesier should interpret the item’s personality based on the description given. A happy intelligent item might sing or whistle, even at inappropriate times, whereas a cowardly one might try to convince its possessor not to enter a dangerous situation. Even an intelligent item with Smarts of d12 can be clueless, lacking common sense and knowledge outside its area of expertise.</p><p>If a result is rolled twice, that personality trait becomes stronger—much stronger. A suspicious intelligent item may become paranoid, or a lazy one refuses to function unless cajoled, bribed, or threatened.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Personality</th><th>d20</th><th>Personality</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Cruel</td><td>11</td><td>Heroic</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Happy</td><td>12</td><td>Insane</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Gung Ho</td><td>13</td><td>Bloodthirsty</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Lazy</td><td>14</td><td>Optimistic</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Manipulative</td><td>15</td><td>Pessimistic</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Crude</td><td>16</td><td>Suspicious</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Clueless</td><td>17</td><td>Talkative</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Mysterious</td><td>18</td><td>Helpful</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Creative</td><td>19</td><td>Contrary</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Cowardly</td><td>20</td><td>Aloof</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h3>Goals</h3><p>Every intelligent item has a goal or ambition—some have more than one. For each goal the intelligent item has, roll once on the table below. The goals are only given brief descriptors and should not be taken literally. As with the item’s personality, the Prophesier should interpret what form the goal takes and how the relic intends to achieve it. For example, “Aid a certain people” might mean to help that society evolve or assist an organization achieve its goals or perform specific tasks, and “destroy a certain people” doesn’t necessarily mean committing genocide, but instead put an end to a group’s tyranny or keep them from achieving a dangerous goal such as releasing an Overlord or daelkyr lord.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Goal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1–2</td><td>Promote a religion</td></tr><tr><td>3–4</td><td>Oppose a religion</td></tr><tr><td>5–6</td><td>Overthrow tyranny</td></tr><tr><td>7–8</td><td>Overthrow a just ruler</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Become a ruler</td></tr><tr><td>10–11</td><td>Avenge some slight</td></tr><tr><td>12–13</td><td>Acquire fame and glory</td></tr><tr><td>14–15</td><td>Destroy a certain people</td></tr><tr><td>16–17</td><td>Aid a certain people</td></tr><tr><td>18–19</td><td>See the world</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Gain a permanent body or be destroyed</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h3>Battle of Wills</h3><p>Generally, intelligent items are content to go along with their possessor so long as it does not directly go against their personality or goal. When the intelligent item and its possessor have different opinions over a course of action, the intelligent item initiates a battle of wills with an opposed Spirit roll against the possessor. An intelligent item may instigate a battle of wills only once per day, whether or not it is successful.</p><p>If the intelligent item wins the opposed roll, it gains control of the possessor for 24 hours. During this time, the character’s personality is suppressed by the intelligent item, which can use the body as if it were its own. The intelligent item uses its own Smarts and Spirit and its own skills, and it can use the owner’s Edges.</p><p>If the intelligent item tries to do something the adventurer finds abhorrent, such as killing allies, the adventurer may make another Spirit roll to break free from the domination. If the intelligent item got a raise on the initially opposed Spirit roll, the adventurer’s Spirit rolls to break free include a −2 penalty.</p></section><section><h3>Activating Powers</h3><p>Intelligent items have limited control of the powers contained within them. While they cannot activate their own powers, an intelligent item can prevent them from working. Even “always on” items are affected.</p><p>The owner can force a recalcitrant item to allow him access to the power, but he must win a battle of wills.</p></section><section><h3>Fear</h3><p>While intelligent items can’t run away or suffer heart attacks, they are still susceptible to fear. If they fail a Fear check, they become Panicked. They cannot use any of their skills and automatically attempt a battle of wills (even if they already have attempted one that day).</p><p>If they win, they dominate their owner and force him to flee. When the Panic ends, the intelligent item usually returns control of the body.</p></section></section></article>"
