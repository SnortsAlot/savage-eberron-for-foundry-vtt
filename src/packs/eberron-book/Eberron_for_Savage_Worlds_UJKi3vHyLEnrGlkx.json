        "content": "<article id=\"chapter-two-adventurers\" class=\"savage-eberron --article\"><p>In the world of <cite>Eberron</cite>, characters are known as adventurers, and the Game Master has the title of Prophesier.</p><p>Before you get started creating your adventurer, you’ll want to download a copy of the <cite>Eberron for Savage Worlds</cite> character sheet from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://immaterialplane.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1691623482354526&amp;usg=AOvVaw3rWV8E6yKWGJARvcJz4ZXI\">immaterialplane.com</a>.</p><section><h2>Concept</h2><p><cite>Eberron</cite> is filled with a wide range of roles and professions. You can choose to play a ranger who knows how to survive in the wild, a wizard who studies the very magic that permeates this world, an artificer who can infuse that magic into tools and weapons, or any other role you can conceive using the rules below.</p></section><section><h2>Ancestry</h2><p>This book includes 11 ancestries from which your adventurer could be a descendant. Each has unique abilities inherent to them.</p></section><section><h2>Hindrances</h2><p>Your adventurer might have flaws that impede achieving their goals and objectives, but heroes often do great things despite—and sometimes because of—their flaws. Hindrances represent those flaws be they physical disabilities, troublesome personality traits, or dark secrets your adventurer might be hiding.</p><p>You can take up to 4 points of Hindrances.</p><p>A Major Hindrance is worth 2 points, and a Minor is worth 1. An adventurer could thus take two Major Hindrances, four Minor, or any combination that adds up to 4 points. (You can take more Hindrances if you want, but the maximum benefit is 4 points!)</p><p>Taking Hindrances not only helps you define your adventurer but also gives you additional points you can use to start with additional attributes or skill points, Edges, or even money for gear.</p><p>For 2 points you can:</p><ul><li>Raise an attribute one die type, or</li><li>Choose an Edge</li></ul><p>For 1 point you can:</p><ul><li>Gain another skill point.</li><li>Start play with an additional 500 gold pieces.</li></ul></section><section><h2>Traits</h2><p>Characters are defined by attributes and skills, collectively called “Traits,” and both work in exactly the same way. Attributes and skills are ranked by die types, typically from d4 to d12, with d6 being the average for adult humans. Higher is better!</p><section><h3>Attributes</h3><p>Every character starts with a d4 in each of five attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, and Vigor (discussed in more detail in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>).</p><p>You then have 5 points to increase your attributes. Raising a d4 to a d6, for example, costs 1 point. You’re free to spend these points however you like, except that no attribute may ever be raised above a d12. If an Edge or power increases the attribute beyond d12, each increase adds a +1 modifier. Increasing a d12 Strength two steps, for example, is a Strength score of d12 + 2.</p></section><section><h3>Skills</h3><p>Skills are learned abilities such as firing weapons, hand-to-hand combat, arcane knowledge, professional aptitudes, and so on. Skills in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> are very broad to keep the action simple and straightforward. The Shooting skill, for example, covers bows, crossbows, wands, and other ranged weapons.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Core Skills:</span> Athletics, Common Knowledge, Notice, Persuasion, and Stealth are “innate” abilities most adult adventurers have. Your adventurer starts with a d4 in each of these core skills.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Buying Skills:</span> After core skills are assigned, you have 15 additional points to raise core skills or buy and raise new skills as you see fit.</p><p>Each die type costs 1 point (starting at d4) as long as the skill is equal to or less than the attribute to which it’s linked to (listed beside the skill in parentheses). If you exceed the linked attribute, the cost becomes 2 points per die type.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Skill Maximums:</span> Skills may not be increased above d12 during character creation unless the character starts with the skill at d6. If the skill starts with a d6, increase her maximum to d12 + 1. A wizard might start with a d6 in spellcasting, for example, which means that skill may be increased to d12 + 1.</p></section></section><section><h2>Derived Statistics</h2><p>Your character sheet contains a few other statistics you need to fill in, described below.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Pace</span> is how fast your adventurer moves in tactical situations like combat. Standard Pace is 6, which means six tabletop inches per game round. Each inch is two yards in the real world. Movement is explained in detail in the <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> core rules.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Parry</span> is equal to 2 plus half your character’s Fighting die type (a total of 2 if a character doesn’t have Fighting), plus any bonuses for shields or certain weapons. This is the Target Number (TN) to hit your hero in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>For Fighting skills higher than d12, such as d12 + 1, add half the fixed modifier, rounded down. For instance, Fighting d12 + 1 grants a Parry of 8, while Fighting d12 + 2 results in a Parry of 9.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Size:</span> A hero’s default Size is 0 unless altered by racial abilities, Edges, or Hindrances. It cannot be less than −1 or more than +3.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Toughness</span> is your adventurer’s damage threshold. Damage rolls that equal or exceed this number cause harm (see Damage in the Savage Worlds core rules).</p><p>Toughness is 2 plus half your adventurer’s Vigor, plus Armor (use the armor worn on his torso). Vigor over a d12 is calculated just like Parry, above.</p></section><section><h2>Edges</h2><p>Attributes and skills are an adventurer’s basic statistics, but what really makes individuals different are their Edges. One might focus on Leadership Edges that lets him rally his fellow soldiers while another concentrates on taking out large numbers of foes at once with Sweep or Frenzy.</p><p>Who your adventurer was and what role they served previously in their life (likely during the Last War) shapes who they are now and who they might become. All adventurers start with a free Background or Professional Edge that reflects the character’s previous life. They may gain additional Edges by taking Hindrances or Advances once play begins. Any additional Edges taken during character creation could expand on that background or take them on a new path.</p><p>Available Edges can be found in this book, in the <cite>Savage Worlds</cite> core rules, and in the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>.</p></section><section><h2>Gear</h2><p>Adventurers begin play with gear and weapons appropriate for their skills and background. This includes appropriate clothing for extreme temperatures, equipment such as rope or climbing gear, or tools used for specific skills such as Thievery. For example, if you’re playing a veteran of the Last War, your adventurer might still possess the armor and weapons issued to them during the war. The Prophesier has the final say in determining whether your list of gear is appropriate.</p></section><section><h2>Background Details</h2><p>Your character became an adventurer for a reason. Think about what impact the Last War had on their lives. If they’re of an ancestry with a longer life span, how long have they lived through the war? If they’re part of an organization, why and how did they come to be so? If they’re no longer a member of a particular organization, why not?</p><p>Additionally, players are strongly encouraged to discuss with each other what binds their adventurers together.</p></section><section><h2>Ancestries</h2><p>The ancestries presented below are balanced to 4 points of positive abilities.</p><section><h3>Changeling</h3><ul><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Change Appearance (+3):</span> As an action, changelings can alter physical features to appear as another humanoid form up to one Size larger or smaller but cannot alter their clothing or gear. This ability does not have a limited duration. The change of appearance grants changelings a +4 to Performance rolls when attempting to impersonate another individual they’ve observed. If killed, they automatically return to their natural form.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Changeling Instincts (+2):</span> Changelings are socially and psychologically intuitive due to their adoption and understanding of different personas. They add +1 to Intimidation and Persuasion rolls.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Outsider (−1):</span> Changelings have the Outsider (Minor) Hindrance. If identified as a changeling, they have −1 to Persuasion as other races tend to distrust them, but their changeling instincts still give them some advantage.</li></ul></section><section><h3>Dwarf</h3><ul><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Darkvision (+1):</span> Dwarven eyes are accustomed to the dark of the underearth. They can see in Pitch Darkness up to 10” (20 yards), ignoring all Illumination penalties and up to 2 points of penalties from invisibility or similar powers.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Reduced Pace (−1):</span> Dwarves have short legs compared to human-sized ancestries. Decrease their Pace by 1 and their running die one die type.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Stonecunning (+1):</span> Generations of delving into the depths of the Mror Holds has taught the Dwarves how to identify unusual stonework, granting them the Stonecunning Edge.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Tough (+3):</span> Dwarves are genetically stout and tough. They start with a d6 in Vigor instead of a d4. This increases their maximum Vigor to d12+1. They also have a +1 bonus to resist poisons, powers, and supernatural abilities that behave similarly to powers.</li></ul></section><section><h3>Elf</h3><ul><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Agile (+2):</span> Elves are graceful and agile. They start with a d6 in Agility instead of a d4. This increases their maximum Agility to d12+1.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Frail (−1):</span> Elves aren’t as sturdy as most other ancestries. Their Toughness is reduced by 1.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Keen Vision (+1):</span> Elves have +2 to Notice rolls to detect obscured or hidden features.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Low Light Vision (+1):</span> Elven eyes amplify light.

Creating an item requires appropriate raw materials costing half the item’s market value and appropriate tools. Making something is usually resolved as an extended skill check, with each skill roll representing roughly a day’s work, though this may be smaller for particularly simple jobs.</p><p>The number of successes required and modifiers depend on the complexity, size, and cost of the item to be created, as well as the availability of necessary resources and tools, as determined by the Prophesier. A critical failure on a skill roll means the work has been ruined and the raw materials wasted.</p></section><section><h3>Driving (Agility)</h3><p>Driving enables House Orien heirs with the Mark of Passage to control a lightning rail or elemental land cart. Because the bound elemental handles the majority of the propulsion, Driving typically is only needed in dangerous situations.</p></section><section><h3>Imbuing (Smarts)</h3><p>This is the skill artificers use to embed magical infusions into an object or construct (see Artificer in Arcana).</p></section><section><h3>Language (Smarts)</h3><p>The world of Eberron features many cultures and races.

Its color shifts subtly and is hard to describe, which gives it a striking and strangely beautiful appearance. Characters wearing glamerweave clothing gain an additional +1 bonus to Persuasion rolls in social interactions.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> +100 gp; <span class=\"inline-subheading\">Weight:</span> −1lb</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Shiftweave:</span> See Miscellaneous Magic Items.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Tailored Formal Clothes:</span> This set of clothes is designed specifically to be expensive and to show it.

These rings are set with large gemstones that contain an intricate runic pattern—actually an arcane mark—that becomes visible when worn by the person for whom it was constructed. It is extremely unusual for anyone who does not have the Aristocrat Edge as a member of a dragonmarked house to wear an arcane signet ring.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 150 gp</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Signet Brooch:</span> Members of a house, whether actual scions or high-standing employees, sometimes wear signet brooches instead of arcane signet rings to identify their affiliation. Signet brooches don’t contain arcane marks.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 75 gp</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Identification Papers:</span> Most people of the middle and upper classes, at least in the most civilized areas of Khorvaire (Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, Zilargo, and the Mror Holds) carry identification papers with them at all times. Issued by national governments and notarized by House Sivis, these papers present a detailed physical description of a person (the wealthy sometimes commission small portraits of themselves), the person’s name and residence, and in some cases additional information about the person’s affiliations (particularly including any connection to a dragonmarked house, royalty, or a large institution).</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 2gp, 5gp with portrait</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Letter of Marque:</span> The concept of letters of marque originated during the Last War, when the rulers of the warring nations granted adventurers permission to attack ships and assets belonging to other nations. The Treaty of Thronehold declared void all letters of marque that existed at the time, but the idea survives in Breland, though in a rather altered form. The king of Breland now issues papers granting adventurers permission to explore and plunder the ruins of Xen’drik. Though such permission is not technically necessary, wise adventurers are sure to secure it before using Sharn as a launching point for expeditions to Xen’drik. Those who try to sell treasures from Xen’drik on the open market in Breland must produce a letter of marque or face stiff fines—on top of forfeiting the treasure they won on their adventures.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 500 gp</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Traveling Papers:</span> Anyone who travels across national borders is usually required to carry traveling papers identifying them, their residence, their destination, and their reason for travel. Traveling papers consist of a parchment sheet with the appropriate information and an arcane mark, carried in a leather folder. House Sivis, House Orien, House Deneith, and House Lyrandar all offer traveling papers that are recognized throughout central Khorvaire.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> .2 gp</p></section><section><h2>Tools and Skill Kits</h2><table><caption>Tools and Skill Kits</caption><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Weight</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Glyphbook</td><td>2</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><p><em>Notes:</em> Grants a +2 bonus on Language rolls made to read inscriptions on Xen'drik ruins.

Additionally, armors made of bronzewood negate Armor Interference penalties to Stealth rolls made in woodland environments.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Byeshk:</span> This rare, purple metal mined from the Byeshk and Graywall Mountains is hard and dense. It provides a +1 bonus to damage and is highly effective against aberrations such as the daelkyr and their twisted creations inflicting +4 damage. It also has Hardness 17 and weighs 50% more than iron weapons, byeshk weapons cost 1,500 gp more. While armor can be made from byeshk, it offers no additional benefits. Being a difficult metal to work with, Repair rolls to mend byeshk weapons have a −4 penalty.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Densewood:</span> A hard, heavy wood, densewood has a higher Hardness than normal wood by 2 and doubles the weight of items typically made of normal wood as well as the cost of the base item. This increase in cost is not applied to the costs of masterwork components or magical enchantments on the item.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Dragonshard:</span> Dragonshards are used as sources of magical power for crafting and powering magic items and as material components when conducting rituals (see <strong>Rituals</strong> in the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>). An unattuned dragonshard has Hardness 10. The process of attunement softens a stone slightly, reducing its Hardness to 8.</p><table><caption>Dragonshards</caption><thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Value Range</th><th>Average Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=\"3\"><span class=\"table-subheading\">Siberys Shards</span></th></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>[[/r 4d4 * 25 # Small Siberys shard value]]{4d4 × 25}</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>[[/r 4d4 * 200 # Large Siberys shard value]]{4d4 × 200}</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Greater</td><td>[[/r 2d4 * 1000 # Greater Siberys shard value]]{2d4 × 1,000}</td><td>5,000</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=\"3\"><span class=\"table-subheading\">Eberron Shards</span></th></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>[[/r 1d8 # Small Eberron shard value]]{1d8}</td><td>4.5</td></tr><tr><td>Greater</td><td>[[/r 4d4 * 10 # Greater Eberron shard value]]{4d4 × 10}</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=\"3\"><span class=\"table-subheading\">Khyber Shards</span></th></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>[[/r 4d4 * 75 # Small Khyber shard value]]{4d4 × 75}</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>Greater</td><td>[[/r 4d4 * 500 # Greater Khyber shard value]]{4d4 × 500}</td><td>5,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Flametouched Iron:</span> This substance, considered sacred by the Church of the Silver Flame, has a speckled, dark, rust-red color in its natural form. When refined, it becomes a shimmering silver hue. Flametouched iron has all of the same physical properties as normal iron except it possesses supernatural properties based on the form it takes.</p><p>A flametouched iron weapon is treated as good-aligned for purposes of extra damage to creatures with such a weakness. Flametouched iron armor grants Arcane Resistance against powers of evil outsiders. A flametouched iron holy symbol grants a +2 bonus to a cleric’s free rerolls from using their holy symbol and adds +1d6 damage when using the Destroy Undead Edge.</p><p>A flametouched iron weapon or suit of armor costs an additional +1,000 gp, and a flametouched iron holy symbol costs 750 gp.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Livewood:</span> When livewood trees are cut down, they remain completely alive while still being worked like normal hardwood. This allows for powers that normally affect plants to interact with livewood objects as if they were living plants. For example, a druid who can teleport from tree to tree could also teleport to livewood objects. Dryads melded inside a livewood tree could end up stuck in a livewood object.</p><p>Livewood has Hardness 6. The cost of a livewood item is +50% the cost of the same item made from normal wood.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Riedran Crysteel:</span>  Riedran crysteel is an alloy composed of iron and a crystalline mineral substance mined in Riedra through operations overseen by the Inspired.  Weapons forged with crysteel resonate with psionic power, and have a +1 bonus to damage when wielded by anyone who has psionic abilities. Crysteel items have Hardness 10. Such weapons cost an additional 1,500 gp.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Soarwood:</span> This magically buoyant wood grows plentifully in the subcontinent of Aerenal. Soarwood is critical in the construction and operation of elemental airships and galleons. It weighs as much as air meaning it will float, but not rise. Any amount of weight added to the soarwood will cause it to fall. Water vessels made from soarwood double their speed and cost four times as much. Soarwood has the same Hardness as normal wood (Hardness 8) but weighs only 75% as much.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Targath:</span> Mined on the northern coast of Argonnessen, targath is soft and often fashioned into magical items that grant health benefits. For example, just a small portion of targath carried or worn protects the possessor with a +2 bonus on Vigor rolls to resist infection from a disease.</p><p>Targath is harmful to the deathless of Aerenal. A metal weapon forged from Targath inflicts +4 additional damage to deathless beings but also suffers a −1 penalty to attack and damage rolls due to their weaker composition. Targath has Hardness 9. Its cost varies based on the type of item being crafted. Ammunition cost +3 gp, one-handed weapons cost +30 gp per damage die type, and two-handed weapons cost +200 gp.</p></section><section><h2>Armor</h2><table><caption>Armor</caption><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Armor</th><th>Min Str.</th><th>Weight</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=\"5\"><span class=\"table-subheading\">Light</span></th></tr><tr><td>Leafweave</td><td>+2</td><td>d4</td><td>11</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><p><em>Notes:</em> Reduces Armor Interference penalties by 1.</p></td></tr><tr class=\"striping-offset\"></tr><tr><td>Darkleaf Breastplate</td><td>+4</td><td>d6</td><td>30</td><td>2,450</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h2>Melee Weapons</h2><table><caption>Melee Weapons</caption><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Damage</th><th>Min Str.</th><th>Weight</th><th>Cost</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Scimitar, Valenar Double</td><td>Str+d6</td><td>d6</td><td>15</td><td>125</td><td>Parry +1, Two Hands, can be used as if a weapon in each hand.</td></tr><tr><td>Sharrash, Talenta</td><td>Str+d10</td><td>d10</td><td>10</td><td>18</td><td>Reach 1, Two Hands.

The mind blade is about the size of a short sword and does Str+d6 damage and is considered a magic weapon for purposes of exploiting weaknesses. The nature of the mind blade reduces the minimum Strength requirement of the weapon by one die type. It has Hardness 10 and can be sundered. If destroyed, the mind blade dissipates, and the soulknife may form a new mind blade on their next turn. Mind blades are susceptible to <em>dispel</em> or other sources that might nullify psionic effects.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Throw Mind Blade:</span> A soulknife can throw his mind blade as a ranged weapon with an Athletics (throwing) roll. The base range for throwing a mind blade is 3/6/12.

Off-hand and wielding two weapons at once still apply, unless the soulknife has Ambidextrous or Two-Fisted respectively.</p></section><section><h5>Knife to the Soul</h5><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Requirements:</span> Heroic, Arcane Background (Soulknife), Psionics d10+</p><p>A mind blade has the potential to cut deep into the victim’s psyche. The soulknife adds <em>lower Trait</em> (Smarts and Spirit only) to his list of known powers. The Range of the power is Touch only and delivered through his mind blade with a successful attack or touch attack. The soulknife benefits from these limitations as usual. Activating <em>lower Trait</em> on a mind blade is a limited free action.</p><p>The mind blade is then “charged” with the power until the next successful attack or touch attack.

If the wizard loses his spellbook, he can no longer cast powers if he has not recovered it by the next sunset or sunrise, whichever comes first.</p><p>After accessing his stored collection of notes, scrolls, tomes, and other arcane writings, a wizard may replace a lost spellbook with a week of work and 500 gp.</p></section></section></section></section><section><h2>Arcane Devices</h2><p>Creating an arcane device requires the Craft Magic Items Edge, which is simply the original Artificer Edge renamed.</p><section><h3>Using Dragonshards</h3><p>Attuned Eberron dragonshards can facilitate the creation of arcane devices by allowing the creator to imbue the device with Power Points without having to sacrifice her own. By grinding them into a powder to be infused into the materials, or by embedding them into a “socket” directly onto the item, the dragonshard can provide 1 Power Point per 100 gp of its value. The dragonshards can either be ground into a powder and infused into the materials and substances, or the crafter can embed the dragonshard directly onto the item. Once the dragonshard’s Power Points are spent, the shard becomes dull and brittle and might even crumble.</p></section></section><section><h2>Prepared Powers</h2><p>All Arcane Backgrounds except Artificer are able to use the rules for Prepared Powers as presented in the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>.</p><section><h3>Dragonshards in Ritual Magic</h3><p>The caster can pay the cost of performing a ritual with one or more dragonshards with a combined value of that cost. Most rituals use Eberron dragonshards, but the Prophesier might require an appropriate type such as Siberys dragonshards for enhancing psionic powers or Khyber dragonshards for binding entities.</p></section></section><section><h2>Spellcasting Services</h2><p>Magic is a massive industry in <cite>Eberron</cite>, and many of the Dragonmarked Houses and their guilds provide spellcasting services to those who can afford it.</p><p>The cost of these services is 25gp per Power Point. If the effect of a raise is required, the price is doubled. The increased cost for a raise accounts for the Power Points, components (or dragonshards), assistants making Support rolls to achieve the desired result, or multiple attempts to achieve the desired result. If the customer pays for a success only, and the caster’s arcane skill roll results in a raise regardless, the benefits of the raise come with no additional cost.</p><p>Professional casters have at least a d6 arcane skill. Casters with an arcane skill of d8 or higher are rare and in high demand. The cost of their spellcasting services is doubled for each increased die type.</p><section><h3>Rituals as a Service</h3><p>If the scope of a spellcasting service includes enhanced Effects achievable through Rituals, the cost of the service increases by 50% or 100% if a raise is required. The customer also typically provides or pays for the cost of the Eberron dragonshards used for the Ritual.</p></section></section><section><h2>Powers</h2><p>All powers listed in the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite> are available.

It cannot be removed by force unless the warforged is inert. Attacking a warforged component requires attacking the warforged to whom it is bonded.</p><p>A warforged can activate a component with a single thought as an action with no spoken words or movement required.</p></aside><section><h3>Basic Components</h3><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Armblade (attached component):</span> An <em>armblade</em> consists of a metal cylinder into which the warforged slides her hand and forearm. Its end features a heavy, serrated sword blade. The <em>armblade</em> gives a +1 bonus to Fighting and damage.</p><p>The warforged cannot be disarmed of the <em>armblade</em>. A defender attempting to resist being disarmed from an attack with the <em>armblade</em> suffers an additional −2 penalty to their Strength rolls to resist dropping the item.</p><p>While the <em>armblade</em> is attached, the warforged cannot perform other tasks with that hand. </p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 2,300 gp; <span class=\"inline-subheading\">Weight:</span> 8 lb.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Armbow (attached component):</span> An <em>armbow</em> is a densewood, light repeating crossbow with an unusually thick and rounded stock. It is only usable when attached and locked onto a warforged’s arm, which completely covers the hand. Attacks made with an <em>armbow</em> include a +1 bonus to Shooting and damage.</p><p>As an action, a warforged can magically load and fire an <em>armbow</em> with a thought. A new bolt is immediately created every time the weapon is fired for up to 20 bolts a day.</p><p>As a free action, the warforged can force the <em>armbow</em> to create an additional 5 bolts by drawing on his own life force, inflicting the effects of <em>lower Vigor</em> upon the warforged as if the power were activated with a success. The warforged may make a Spirit roll as a free action at the end of his following turn. He may also use this ability to create a bolt with the <em>smite</em> power imbued upon it.</p><p>An <em>armbow</em> can only use the magical bolts it creates. Bolts crumble when removed from the <em>armbow</em> in any way other than being shot.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 20,000 gp; <span class=\"inline-subheading\">Weight:</span> 12 lb.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Battlefist (attached component):</span> This component appears to be a massively oversized spiked gauntlet. It is as if it were designed for a creature two Sizes larger. It is only usable when attached and locked onto a warforged’s arm, which completely covers the hand.</p><p>A <em>battlefist</em> has a +1 bonus to Fighting rolls. Using it increases the damage of the warforged’s Steel Fists ability by one die size. This stacks with damage increases from any other features such as the Martial Artist Edge.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 2,600 gp; <span class=\"inline-subheading\">Weight:</span> 6 lb.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Disk of Energy Resistance (embedded component):</span> This component embeds into the chest of a warforged, granting the warforged environmental resistance (+4 resistance / −4 damage) to one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, or fire.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 12,000 gp</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Essence of the Scout (embedded component):</span> Engraved with symbols of silence and stealth, this dark metal disk is embedded into the chest of a warforged granting the character the effects of <em>boost Stealth</em>.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 5,000 gp or 10,000 gp with a raise.</p><aside><h2>Final Messenger</h2><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Attributes:</span> Agility d12, Smarts d4, Spirit d4, Strength 1, Vigor d12</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Skills:</span> Athletics d8, Notice d12, Stealth d8</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Pace:</span> 4; <span class=\"inline-heading\">Parry:</span> 2; <span class=\"inline-heading\">Toughness:</span> 12 (4)</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Special Abilities:</span></p><ul><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Armor +4:</span> Final Messengers are built tough to ensure delivery of their messages.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Construct:</span> +2 to recover from being Shaken; ignores 1 point of Wound penalties; does not breathe or suffer from disease or poison.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Flight:</span> Final Messengers fly at Pace 12\".</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">No Limbs:</span> Cannot perform any meaningful actions other than seeking its target and delivering its message.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Tiny (Size −4):</span> Subtract 4 from Toughness.</li></ul></aside><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Final Messenger (embedded component):</span> A <em>final messenger</em> is a composition of clockwork and filigree wings that attaches to a warforged’s chest. As an action, a warforged may imprint upon an attached <em>final messenger</em> several details of information: a location, a target individual, the image of what the warforged currently sees, and a message of up to 25 words.</p><p>Releasing the <em>final messenger</em> is a free action. Upon release, the <em>messenger</em> flies to the imprinted destination following the most direct route possible. If a targeted individual was specified, it seeks the target as soon as it reaches its destination. If no individual target was specified, it looks for the nearest warforged. A warforged may review the contained message by attaching the <em>final messenger</em>.</p><p>If a warforged with an attached <em>final messenger</em> is destroyed, the <em>messenger</em> retains the stored message but replaces the stored image with the last thing seen by the warforged. It then immediately flies to seek its target.</p><p>A <em>final messenger</em> draws its energy from the warforged to which it is attached. Once detached, it has enough stored energy for up to 8 hours of activity. After 8 hours, it becomes inert. A <em>final messenger</em> can only  replenish its energy by attaching to a warforged. Each minute attached yields enough energy for 1 minute of activity, with a maximum of 8 hours.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 6,000 gp.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Wand Sheath (embedded component):</span> A wand sheath is embedded in a warforged's forearm and hand allowing the warforged to insert a single magic wand into the sheath and merges with the warforged's body.</p><p>The wand remains in the sheath until its Power Points are depleted, at which point the wand drops out of the sheath. If a power stone in the form of a small Eberron dragonshard is used to recharge the wand, it may be reinserted (see <strong>Magic Items</strong> in the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>). Otherwise, a new wand may be inserted in its place.</p><p>A warforged with a loaded <em>wand sheath</em> can activate the wand contained within it with a single thought and by simply pointing a finger.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 4,000 gp.</p></section><section><h3>Docent Components</h3><p>A docent is an intelligent item that emits a strong magical aura, but its abilities are only revealed when it is attached to a warforged and comes to life. Generally, docents are designed to advise and assist the warforged to which it is attached.</p><p>A warforged can only attach one docent. The warforged host can replace one docent with another, but the abilities of the new docent do not activate until 24 hours after the host has removed the previous docent.</p><p>As noted, docents have all of the same characteristics and properties as other intelligent items  (see <strong>Intelligent Items</strong> below) but with the following additional features.</p><ul><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Mind Rider:</span> A docent maintains a telepathic link with the warforged to whom it is attached. It can sense through any of the warforged’s senses, and the warforged may allow it to communicate using its own voice.</li><li><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Languages:</span> All docents understand Giant and Common as two of its known languages (see <strong>Multiple Languages</strong> in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>). Having their origins in Xen’drik, most docents might know Elven or Draconic as well but wouldn’t know other languages. They may fill the remainder of their known languages immediately upon encountering them.</p></li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Innate Powers:</span> Docents have one or more Innate Powers. Roll or choose 1d4 times on Table A: Docent Powers to select the powers it knows. If a power is rolled more than once, reroll or choose a different power. It’s important to note that these powers belong to the docent and not the warforged.</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Docent Power</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-5</td><td><em>detect arcana</em></td></tr><tr><td>6-10</td><td><em>empathy</em></td></tr><tr><td>11-15</td><td><em>mind link</em></td></tr><tr><td>16-18</td><td><em>speed</em></td></tr><tr><td>19-20</td><td><em>scrying</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> Docents are priceless ancient artifacts found in the depths of Xen’drik’s wilderness.</p></section><section><h3>Artifact Components</h3><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Circlet of Preservation (attached component):</span> This heavy, blackened adamantine torc has embedded rubies in its ends. It reveals its powers when a warforged attaches it around the neck. When a warforged’s body becomes inert due to damage, the <em>torc</em> absorbs the warforged’s consciousness and repairs his injuries. The <em>circlet</em> repairs one Wound every 8 hours. When the first Wound is repaired, the warforged’s consciousness is transferred back.</p><p>The <em>circlet</em> can be removed while the warforged is inert. Removing the <em>circlet</em> prevents it from repairing the warforged. The <em>circlet</em> retains the warforged’s consciousness when removed. If another warforged attaches the <em>circlet</em>, the two warforged immediately make opposed Spirit rolls to gain control of the body. The loser’s consciousness is then trapped within the <em>circlet</em>. Similar to a battle of wills with an intelligent item, another opposed roll can be made once every 24 hours. The trapped consciousness effectively becomes a docent. As with a docent, a warforged may allow the trapped consciousness within the circlet to take over the body, but this switch may only occur once every 24 hours.</p><p>A <em>circlet of preservation</em> has a Hardness of 25, and it repairs its own Wounds at a rate of 1 Wound every hour.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Tauric Belt (attached component):</span> A <em>tauric belt</em> is made from woven mithral threads and dragonshard studs and has etchings of fantastic beasts. The <em>belt</em> allows the warforged to take an action to shape change its lower body into a leonine form composed of mithral, steel, and darkwood. It may also take an action to return to humanoid form.</p><p>The tauric form confers the following abilities.</p><ul><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Size 2:</span> While its humanoid torso remains the same size, the tauric body as a whole is larger.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Pace:</span> The warforged’s Pace is increased by +2 and his running die is increased a die type.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Increased Attributes:</span> The warforged’s Strength increases by two die types and its Vigor increases by one die type, both of which may become d12+1 or higher.</li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Claws:</span> In addition to its steel fists, the warforged’s “paws” may be used to make claw attacks dealing Str+d4 damage.</li></ul></section></section><section><h2>Traditional Magic Items</h2><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Oil of Repair:</span> <em>Oil of repair</em> instantly repairs one Wound and all Fatigue.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 250 gp</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Circle of Sound:</span> <em>Circles of sound </em>are magical rings that come in sets of two or more. The wearer of one ring can whisper into it, sending a message to anyone wearing a ring from the same set. The other rings must be within 220 feet to receive the message.</p><p>Only rings forged as part of the initial set of <em>circles of sound</em> can communicate with the rest of the set.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 2,000 gp (per ring).</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Conductor Stone:</span> <em>Conductor</em> stones are glowing orbs used to drive the lightning rails spread across Khorvaire. The line of <em>conductor stones</em> on a given route repel against those covering the underside of a lightning rail car, keeping the cars afloat. The stones generate a field of visible electrical energy that arcs between adjacent stones and over the body of the coach.</p><p>Creative artificers and entrepreneurs have also designed alternative modes of transportation that run along <em>conductor stone</em> lines at high speeds. Unfortunately, they do not have the same weight of a lightning rail coach to counter the repulsion between stones, causing them to careen off the line when control is lost.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Orrery of the Planes:</span> Typically a little more than 1 foot in diameter, an <em>orrery of the planes</em> depicts Eberron, its twelve moons, and the Ring of Siberys. The <em>orrery</em> is forged from adamantine with tiny dragonshards embedded into its surfaces. It tracks the motion of the moons around Eberron and through its ring. The true power of the orrery is its connection to the planes of existence that surround the Material Plane.</p><p>Once per day, an owner of an <em>orrery of the planes</em> can create a localized manifest zone linked to a specific plane 10” (60 feet) in diameter. The zone is active for 24 hours, creating an effect based on the linked plane of existence as described below.</p><aside><h2>Pseudonatural Creatures</h2><p>Pseudonatural creatures dwell in the plane of Xoriat.

In contrast to traditional intelligent items, a symbiont already has specific attributes and skills, and its personality and goals are always connected to those of the daelkyr and generally alien ideologies.</p><p>The creature stats for each symbiont are listed in the Bestiary.</p><section><h3>Living Breastplate</h3><ul><li>When a host attaches or removes a living breastplate, his Strength decreases by one die type for 24 hours.</li><li>A living breastplate increases its host's Vigor by two die types, increasing its maximum by two as well. It also grants its host +4 Armor.</li><li>If its host is bleeding out, a living breastplate automatically stabilizes the host as a free action.</li></ul></section><section><h3>Tentacle Whip</h3><ul><li>When a host attaches a tentacle whip, his Agility decreases by one die type for 24 hours, but this injury is inflicted again every 24 hours.</li><li>The host is unable to wield any weapons or shields in the hand to which the whip is attached. Regardless of which hand the tentacle whip is attached to, it is never regarded as an off-hand weapon.</li><li>A tentacle whip serves as a melee weapon that deals Str+d4 damage and with Reach 2. If a victim is at least Shaken from the sting attack, the tentacle whip injects a Mild Poison into the target. With a raise on the attack roll, the victim is also Vulnerable until his next action.</li><li>A tentacle whip grants a +2 to Disarm attempts</li><li>The host can use the tentacle whip to deliver touch-based powers.</li><li>Independently of the host’s actions, a tentacle whip can attack using its own Fighting skill.</li></ul></section><section><h3>Tongueworm</h3><ul><li>When a host attaches or detaches a tongueworm, his Vigor decreases by one die type for 24 hours.</li><li><p>Once attached, tongueworm grants its hosts a sting attack that deals Str+d4 damage.

If the wielder has the Repel Aberration Edge, he can choose to imbue the spear with the <em>smite</em> power by making a Fighting or Athletics (throwing) attack roll with the spear. A raise on the attack roll also increases the <em>smite</em> damage as per the power’s description. The spear has 10 Power Points per day for this ability, which refresh at sunrise. If the character accidentally <em>smites</em> a creature that is not an aberration, the <em>smite</em> has no effect, but the power points are still expended.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Breastplate of Kamvuul Norek:</span> This armor is a <em>+2 medium fortification adamantine breastplate</em>, and additionally gives its wearer Arcane Resistance against psionic powers and abilities. If the wearer of the Breastplate of Kamvuul Norek makes a successful Vigor roll to resist the effects of the <em>stun</em> power, the <em>stun</em> deflects off of the wearer and affects the attacker instead.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Ghaal’duur, the Mighty Dirge:</span> The great horn Ghaal’duur is carved from a red dragon's horn. An adventurer must have at least a d10 in Performance to use the horn effectively. A bard who sounds the horn receives a +2 bonus on all Performance checks involving music. The opposed rolls against a bard's spells activated with a Performance using the horn have a –2 penalty, and the cost of Power Modifiers on a spell decrease by 1 Power Point. If a bard uses the horn to cast <em>boostTrait</em>, the affected trait also gains a +1 bonus to rolls and the range is increased to 1,000 feet. Additionally, all enemies of the bard within 1,000 feet suffer a –2 penalty on attack rolls, damage rolls, and opposed rolls against <em>empathy</em>, <em>fear</em>, and <em>puppet</em>. If the targets are goblinoid, the bonuses and penalties are doubled.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Mace of Thundering Vengeance:</span> This <em>aberration bane thundering byeshk heavy mace</em> grants +2 Fighting and deals an additional 1d6 sonic energy damage when attacking aberrations. Additionally, if the wielder makes a successful Fighting roll while striking the ground, the strike activates the <em>blast</em> power in the form of a rumbling thunder that deals, dealing 2d6 damage in a Medium Blast Template</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Resplendent Armor of Dhakaan:</span> This set of <em>fortification breastplate</em>, <em>greaves</em>, and <em>vambraces</em> bestows the wearer with major <em>arcane protection</em>. Additionally, anyone casting <em>detect arcana</em> or <em>locate</em> against the target suffers an additional −2 penalty to the arcane skill roll.</p><p>As a limited action, the wearer may cast minor <em>boost Spirit</em> on a number of recipients equal to his rank.</p></section><section><h2>Wondrous Locations</h2><p>Wondrous locations are powerful magic items that cannot be moved. Their prices are based on its cost to create it rather than a market value, but if it's part of a stronghold that the character is selling, its price could be included.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Dimensional Seal:</span> Carved with a complex pattern of runes and sigils, this massive slab of stone projects a field that negates all extradimensional travel and nullifies the typical effects of a manifest zone. This effect spans a radius of 2 miles centered on the <em>dimensional seal</em>. Destroying a <em>dimensional seal</em> would reactivate the effects of the manifest zone and unlock extradimensional travel.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Eldritch Machine:</span> An eldritch machine is effectively a harnessed <em>wish</em> spell. In other words, eldritch machines can do almost anything, but exclusively limited to one effect.</p><p>An eldritch machine usually serves as a plot device, sending the adventurers on a quest to find a way to construct such a machine or even destroy it.</p><p>Eldritch machines do not follow the conventional rules for arcane devices, magic items, or powers in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>. Creating an eldritch machine requires no specific powers. The requirements for creating one are many, specific, and highly restrictive with respect to its construction, components, and location. The Prophesier should feel free to require whatever components deemed necessary. One of the most common key requirements is the construction taking place in the presence of a manifest zone. Materials and substances needed are often rare or even unique.</p><p>The process of constructing an eldritch machine should be a critical part of the campaign or adventure. Discovering the means to create one and assembling the components necessary could result in an adventure to multiple destinations such as the haunted ruins of Xen'drik or the Burning Keep in the Demon Wastes. It might even require the use of <em>mystic intervention</em> to gain assistance from a powerful extraplanar patron.</p><p>Operating an eldritch machine is no simple task. Activation usually requires the user has the Arcane Background Edge, appropriate skills such as Occult or an arcane skill, and familiarity with the machine's function. There is also a significant risk to using an eldritch machine as they are unstable. Testing the machine before operating it at full power is crucial, and the chance of a catastrophe is very real. Even if one were to come into possession of an eldritch machine, it might not even function properly or it could very well break or otherwise cease to function.</p><p>Eldritch machines are priceless, and the Prophesier should determine the costs of the components if such values are required.</p><p>In all cases, destroying an eldritch machine should be equally challenging, if not more so.</p><p>Below are several examples of eldritch machines villains or misguided individuals might create.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading --minor\">Emerald Reanimator:</span> All creatures that perish within 2 miles of this eldritch machine immediately animate as a zombie under the control of the device’s creator. An <em>emerald reanimator</em> must be built within a manifest zone linked to Mabar.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading --minor\">Master’s Summons:</span> This eldritch machine requires the knowledge offered by an ancient docent found on Xen’drik. It allows the user to pinpoint the location of any warforged within a radius of 10 miles. It can also allow the user to cast a combination of puppet and mind link on any individual warforged it has located as a limited free action..</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading --minor\">Necromantic Lens:</span> This titanic telescope covers everything within 5 miles of it with negative energy whenever it focuses sunlight through its lens. This effect is only achievable when Mabar, the Endless Night, is coterminous to the Material Plane.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading --minor\">Psychic Disruptor:</span> The appearance of this eldritch machine is reminiscent of the alien dome-cities built by the Inspired. The device can broadcast waves of psychic energy that causes those sleeping within a 3-mile radius to suffer the effects of <em>nightmares</em> power. A large amount of Riedran crysteel and Siberys dragonshards make up the majority of the components required to create a <em>psychic disruptor.</em></p><p><span class=\"inline-heading --minor\">Spell Sink:</span> This pitch-black orb generates an <em>antimagic field</em> that spans 3 miles from its center. The <em>spell sink</em> must be constructed in a location that rests at a nexus of magical energies which is extremely difficult to find.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Siberys Observatory:</span> While Gatekeeper observatories and those created by the dragons of Argonnessen differ in form, they both share the same effects.</p><ul><li>Occult rolls related to the planes made while in a Siberys observatory gain a +2 bonus. This requires the Planar Mastery Edge.</li><li>An adventurer with at least a d8 in Occult or Survival can effortlessly determine which direction is north with respect to the Siberys observatory.</li><li><p>A caster has a +4 bonus to her arcane skill roll when activating a power used for divining knowledge such as <em>detect arcana</em>, <em>divination</em>, <em>locate</em>, or <em>scrying</em>. The Siberys observatory also serves as a substitute for any material components or talisman, eliminating the need to possess either while casting the spell (see <strong>Hindrances</strong> in the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>).</p></li><li>An adventurer in a Siberys observatory can target any dragonmarked character with <em>scrying</em> or <em>locate</em> as if she had previously seen the target, ignoring the usual −2 penalty.</li></ul><p>The site of a Siberys observatory must have a strong balance between Khyber and Siberys for its construction to be successful. Finding such a location might take months or years of surveying. The construction also requires considerably large and pure uncut, unattuned Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber dragonshards which are bound to the location through rituals. This process makes them unusable for any other purpose.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span> 50,000 gp.</p></section><section><h2>Intelligent Items</h2><p>Some magic items are sentient and self-aware. Such items are regarded as intelligent items and are treated as Wild Cards with a Wild Die and two Bennies. They also have three Wounds with regards to being sundered (see <strong>Breaking Things</strong> in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>).</p><p>Players and Prophesiers should think of intelligent items as characters, and not just as magic items that can think. For ease, the Prophesier should allow the player to run the intelligent item as another character they control. Yet, there are times when the intelligent item might decide to be uncooperative (see Battle of Wills below).</p><p>As intelligent items, they can be subjected to mind-affecting powers such as <em>mind reading</em> or <em>puppet</em>. They can also be the subject of Tests.</p><p>Use the tables below to determine the intelligent item’s Traits, personality, and goals.</p><section><h3>Traits</h3><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Attributes:</span> The Attributes column determines how many points an intelligent item has to distribute among Smarts and Spirit, both of which start at d4 and may go beyond a d12 (e.g., d12+1, d12+2, etc.).</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Skills:</span> The Skills column indicates how many skill points the intelligent item has. These are spent in the same way as for making regular adventurers, with one exception—skills may go over the linked attribute without paying double the cost. Intelligent items do not have any core skills.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Attribute Points</th><th>Skill Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1–3</td><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>4–8</td><td>2</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>9–13</td><td>3</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>14–16</td><td>4</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>17–18</td><td>6</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>8</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>10</td><td>20</td></tr></tbody></table><section><h4>Skills</h4><p>The Prophesier can either pick skills from the table or roll randomly. If rolling randomly, each additional time a skill is rolled after the first, it increases a die type. For example, the first time Taunt is rolled on the table, its die type is d4, increasing to d6, d8, and so on each time the skill is rolled again.</p><p>An intelligent item can use some of its skills directly, such as Occult or Persuasion, but others, such as Boating, Gambling, or Stealth, are likely used strictly for Support rolls (see <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>), giving its possessor advice based on its own knowledge.</p><p>The Prophesier has the final word on a when an intelligent item can and can’t assist its possessor.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Skill</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Academics</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Athletics</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Battle</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Boating</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Common Knowledge</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Driving/Piloting (choose one)</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Gambling</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Healing</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Intimidation</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Notice</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Occult</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Performance</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Persuasion</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Repair</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Research</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Riding</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>Stealth</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Survival</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Taunt</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Thievery</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h4>Languages</h4><p>An intelligent item knows Common by default and knows a total number of Language skills equal to its Smarts die type. These languages are typically limited to those known by their creators. They may fill the remainder of their known languages immediately upon encountering them.</p></section></section><section><h3>Senses</h3><p>Intelligent items with the Notice skill can see and hear as if they were a biological creature. Those without the skill receive only vague impressions of what is going on around them—typically they can sense living creatures approaching within 1” (2 yards) but can’t make out specifics such as ancestry.</p><p>When donned or held, as appropriate to the item, it can see and hear everything the owner does. Intelligent items with Notice may use their own skill or that of their possessor.</p><p>Those without the Notice skill are totally reliant on their owner’s abilities—if a character has sensory-affecting Edges or Hindrances, then the item is also affected by them.</p></section><section><h3>Personality</h3><p>Intelligent items are more than just smart objects—they have distinct personalities, goals, drives, and feelings.</p><p>The prophesier should interpret the item’s personality based on the description given. A happy intelligent item might sing or whistle, even at inappropriate times, whereas a cowardly one might try to convince its possessor not to enter a dangerous situation. Even an intelligent item with Smarts of d12 can be clueless, lacking common sense and knowledge outside its area of expertise.</p><p>If a result is rolled twice, that personality trait becomes stronger—much stronger. A suspicious intelligent item may become paranoid, or a lazy one refuses to function unless cajoled, bribed, or threatened.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Personality</th><th>d20</th><th>Personality</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Cruel</td><td>11</td><td>Heroic</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Happy</td><td>12</td><td>Insane</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Gung Ho</td><td>13</td><td>Bloodthirsty</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Lazy</td><td>14</td><td>Optimistic</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Manipulative</td><td>15</td><td>Pessimistic</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Crude</td><td>16</td><td>Suspicious</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Clueless</td><td>17</td><td>Talkative</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Mysterious</td><td>18</td><td>Helpful</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Creative</td><td>19</td><td>Contrary</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Cowardly</td><td>20</td><td>Aloof</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h3>Goals</h3><p>Every intelligent item has a goal or ambition—some have more than one. For each goal the intelligent item has, roll once on the table below. The goals are only given brief descriptors and should not be taken literally. As with the item’s personality, the Prophesier should interpret what form the goal takes and how the relic intends to achieve it. For example, “Aid a certain people” might mean to help that society evolve or assist an organization achieve its goals or perform specific tasks, and “destroy a certain people” doesn’t necessarily mean committing genocide, but instead put an end to a group’s tyranny or keep them from achieving a dangerous goal such as releasing an Overlord or daelkyr lord.</p><table><thead><tr><th>d20</th><th>Goal</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1–2</td><td>Promote a religion</td></tr><tr><td>3–4</td><td>Oppose a religion</td></tr><tr><td>5–6</td><td>Overthrow tyranny</td></tr><tr><td>7–8</td><td>Overthrow a just ruler</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Become a ruler</td></tr><tr><td>10–11</td><td>Avenge some slight</td></tr><tr><td>12–13</td><td>Acquire fame and glory</td></tr><tr><td>14–15</td><td>Destroy a certain people</td></tr><tr><td>16–17</td><td>Aid a certain people</td></tr><tr><td>18–19</td><td>See the world</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>Gain a permanent body or be destroyed</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h3>Battle of Wills</h3><p>Generally, intelligent items are content to go along with their possessor so long as it does not directly go against their personality or goal. When the intelligent item and its possessor have different opinions over a course of action, the intelligent item initiates a battle of wills with an opposed Spirit roll against the possessor. An intelligent item may instigate a battle of wills only once per day, whether or not it is successful.</p><p>If the intelligent item wins the opposed roll, it gains control of the possessor for 24 hours. During this time, the character’s personality is suppressed by the intelligent item, which can use the body as if it were its own. The intelligent item uses its own Smarts and Spirit and its own skills, and it can use the owner’s Edges.</p><p>If the intelligent item tries to do something the adventurer finds abhorrent, such as killing allies, the adventurer may make another Spirit roll to break free from the domination. If the intelligent item got a raise on the initially opposed Spirit roll, the adventurer’s Spirit rolls to break free include a −2 penalty.</p></section><section><h3>Activating Powers</h3><p>Intelligent items have limited control of the powers contained within them. While they cannot activate their own powers, an intelligent item can prevent them from working. Even “always on” items are affected.</p><p>The owner can force a recalcitrant item to allow him access to the power, but he must win a battle of wills.</p></section><section><h3>Fear</h3><p>While intelligent items can’t run away or suffer heart attacks, they are still susceptible to fear. If they fail a Fear check, they become Panicked. They cannot use any of their skills and automatically attempt a battle of wills (even if they already have attempted one that day).</p><p>If they win, they dominate their owner and force him to flee. When the Panic ends, the intelligent item usually returns control of the body.</p></section></section></article>"

Below are some additional abilities that are specific to <cite>Eberron</cite> or otherwise are not presented in those books.</p><section><h3>Aberration</h3><p>Aberrations are strange and alien monstrosities, often with innate psionic abilities. They have Darkvision and are vulnerable to weapons made of byeshk.</p></section><section><h3>Blindsight</h3><p>Blindsight is the ability “see” without the sense of sight. A creature with this ability might have the ability to use echolocation, have an acute sense of smell, or feel vibrations from movement in the air or on the ground. Blindsight can render powers such as <em>invisibility</em> or <em>darkness</em> useless if the creature has a line of effect with its prey. The range of this ability varies by creature.</p><p>A creature with Blindsight also has the same benefits as All-Around Vision Special Ability, but the creature cannot distinguish color or contrast, cannot use the ability to read, is not vulnerable to gaze attacks, and cannot sense anything if in a vacuum. Blindsight renders the creature immune to the <em>blind</em> power, but <em>silence</em> negates Blindsight if the creature relies on hearing for this ability.</p></section><section><h3>Deathless</h3><p>Deathless benefit from the same characteristics as undead (see <strong>Special Abilities</strong> in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>). The energy used to create and heal deathless is positive energy instead of negative energy. They are affected by negative energy just as living creatures are. Deathless are vulnerable to weapons made of targath which inflict an additional +4 damage to deathless beings.</p><section><h3>Engulf</h3><p>The creature can completely swallow or surround targets it moves over, as long as it doesn’t make any other attacks the same round. Victims who fail an Agility roll are engulfed and are subject to attacks from the creature each round on the creature’s turn. Engulfed targets are considered to be Grappled.</p></section><section><h3>Living Construct</h3><p>Living constructs are made from organic and inorganic matter and are capable of emotions and conscious thought. They lack some of the benefits of constructs, but also have some distinct advantages. Living constructs do not need to breathe, eat, or drink, and are immune to disease and poison. Living constructs also don’t need to sleep, and arcane powers can’t put them to sleep; however, they must spend at least six hours in a relaxed state. In this state, living constructs remain conscious, can see and hear as normal, and can perform simple tasks including using the Repair skill on themselves.</p><p>Living constructs cannot heal naturally, and characters using the <em>healing</em> power or Healing skill on them subtract 2 from the respective rolls. With a failed Vigor roll when Incapacitated, they become automatically stabilized but inert and helpless. Injuries on a living construct can only be removed when all wounds are “healed” with the Repair skill or the <em>repairing</em> power.</p></section></section><section><h2>Bestiary</h2><section><h3 class=\"wild-card\">Ascendant Councilor</h3><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Attributes:</span> Agility d10+2, Smarts d12+4, Spirit d12+5, Strength d12+6, Vigor d12+4</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Skills:</span> Academics d12+5, Athletics d4, Battle d12+5, Common Knowledge d12+5, Fighting d12+5, Notice d12+5, Occult d12+5, Persuasion d12+5, Research d12+5, Stealth d4</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Pace:</span> 7; <span class=\"inline-heading\">Parry:</span> 7; <span class=\"inline-heading\">Toughness:</span> 14 (3)</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Edges:</span> Improved Arcane Resistance, Improved Counterattack, Improved First Strike, Planar Mastery</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Special Abilities:</span></p><ul><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Armor +3</span></li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Consecrated Aura:</span> A field of positive energy emanates from an ascendant counselor in a 10” radius.
