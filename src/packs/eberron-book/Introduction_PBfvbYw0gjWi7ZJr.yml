Some of the converted ancestries are designed based on more modern interpretations of races presented in the 5e<em>\_D&amp;D </em>supplement <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>.</p><p>If you or your players are completely new to <cite>Eberron</cite>\_altogether, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dmsguild.com/product/57086/An-Adventurers-Guide-to-Eberron-35?affiliate_id%3D25759&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1691623482349874&amp;usg=AOvVaw2bKFuicl8oF0YHa8ftenFD\"><em>An Adventurer’s Guide to Eberron</em></a>\_provides a very high-level overview of the setting, just enough to give a taste of important factions, themes, locations, and cultures.</p><section><h2>How to Use This Book</h2><p><em>Eberron for Savage Worlds </em>is not a conversion or analog of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</em>\_Your expectations should not be to play <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>\_using <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>, but to use <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>\_to run or play in <cite>Eberron</cite>, an important distinction that makes a difference between feeling excited and feeling disappointed while playing the game. The Dungeon Master—referred to as the Prophesier in this book—should make this distinction clear to players when introducing them to <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>\_and before even beginning to create characters.</p><section><h2>Is This Legal?</h2><p>This document complies with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://company.wizards.com/en/legal/fancontentpolicy&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1691623482350822&amp;usg=AOvVaw3YYnt9ueLxQrBHoaL-_nE5\">Wizards of the Coast’s Fan Content Policy</a>.
