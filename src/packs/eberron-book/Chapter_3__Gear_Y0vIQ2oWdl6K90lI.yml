  content: "<article id=\"chapter-three-gear\" class=\"savage-eberron --article\"><section><h2>Clothing</h2><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Clothing, Darkweave:</span>\_Interwoven strands of shadow and black thread make up this beautiful but coarse cloth. Darkweave clothing grants a +1 bonus to Stealth rolls made in dim light, darkness, or pitch dark.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span>\_+100 gp</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Clothing, Glamerweave:</span>\_Glamerweave is a fine, lightweight fabric with illusions woven into it. Its color shifts subtly and is hard to describe, which gives it a striking and strangely beautiful appearance. Characters wearing glamerweave clothing gain an additional +1 bonus to Persuasion rolls in social interactions.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span>\_+100 gp; <span class=\"inline-subheading\">Weight:</span>\_−1lb</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Shiftweave:</span>\_See Miscellaneous Magic Items.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Tailored Formal Clothes:</span>\_This set of clothes is designed specifically to be expensive and to show it. Anyone wearing tailored clothing may add +1 to his Persuasion rolls in situations where his status has an effect.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span>\_200 gp</p></section><section><h2>Documents</h2><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Arcane Signet Ring:</span>\_Dragonmarked houses use these rings for identification purposes. These rings are set with large gemstones that contain an intricate runic pattern—actually an arcane mark—that becomes visible when worn by the person for whom it was constructed. It is extremely unusual for anyone who does not have the Aristocrat Edge as a member of a dragonmarked house to wear an arcane signet ring.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span>\_150 gp</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Signet Brooch:</span>\_Members of a house, whether actual scions or high-standing employees, sometimes wear signet brooches instead of arcane signet rings to identify their affiliation. Signet brooches don’t contain arcane marks.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span>\_75 gp</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Identification Papers:</span>\_Most people of the middle and upper classes, at least in the most civilized areas of Khorvaire (Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, Zilargo, and the Mror Holds) carry identification papers with them at all times. Issued by national governments and notarized by House Sivis, these papers present a detailed physical description of a person (the wealthy sometimes commission small portraits of themselves), the person’s name and residence, and in some cases additional information about the person’s affiliations (particularly including any connection to a dragonmarked house, royalty, or a large institution).</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span>\_2gp, 5gp with portrait</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Letter of Marque:</span>\_The concept of letters of marque originated during the Last War, when the rulers of the warring nations granted adventurers permission to attack ships and assets belonging to other nations. The Treaty of Thronehold declared void all letters of marque that existed at the time, but the idea survives in Breland, though in a rather altered form. The king of Breland now issues papers granting adventurers permission to explore and plunder the ruins of Xen’drik. Though such permission is not technically necessary, wise adventurers are sure to secure it before using Sharn as a launching point for expeditions to Xen’drik. Those who try to sell treasures from Xen’drik on the open market in Breland must produce a letter of marque or face stiff fines—on top of forfeiting the treasure they won on their adventures.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span>\_500 gp</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Traveling Papers:</span>\_Anyone who travels across national borders is usually required to carry traveling papers identifying them, their residence, their destination, and their reason for travel. Traveling papers consist of a parchment sheet with the appropriate information and an arcane mark, carried in a leather folder. House Sivis, House Orien, House Deneith, and House Lyrandar all offer traveling papers that are recognized throughout central Khorvaire.</p><p><span class=\"inline-subheading\">Price:</span>\_.2 gp</p></section><section><h2>Tools and Skill Kits</h2><table><caption>Tools and Skill Kits</caption><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Weight</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Glyphbook</td><td>2</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><p><em>Notes:</em>\_Grants a +2 bonus on Language rolls made to read inscriptions on Xen'drik ruins.

Additionally, armors made of bronzewood negate Armor Interference penalties to Stealth rolls made in woodland environments.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Byeshk:</span>\_This rare, purple metal mined from the Byeshk and Graywall Mountains is hard and dense. It provides a +1 bonus to damage and is highly effective against aberrations such as the daelkyr and their twisted creations inflicting +4 damage. It also has Hardness 17 and weighs 50% more than iron weapons, byeshk weapons cost 1,500 gp more. While armor can be made from byeshk, it offers no additional benefits. Being a difficult metal to work with, Repair rolls to mend byeshk weapons have a −4 penalty.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Densewood:</span>\_A hard, heavy wood, densewood has a higher Hardness than normal wood by 2 and doubles the weight of items typically made of normal wood as well as the cost of the base item. This increase in cost is not applied to the costs of masterwork components or magical enchantments on the item.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Dragonshard:</span>\_Dragonshards are used as sources of magical power for crafting and powering magic items and as material components when conducting rituals (see <strong>Rituals</strong>\_in the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>). An unattuned dragonshard has Hardness 10. The process of attunement softens a stone slightly, reducing its Hardness to 8.</p><table><caption>Dragonshards</caption><thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>Value Range</th><th>Average Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=\"3\">Siberys Shards</th></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>[[/r 4d4 * 25 # Small Siberys shard value]]{4d4 × 25}</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>[[/r 4d4 * 200 # Large Siberys shard value]]{4d4 × 200}</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Greater</td><td>[[/r 2d4 * 1000 # Greater Siberys shard value]]{2d4 × 1,000}</td><td>5,000</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=\"3\">Eberron Shards</th></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>[[/r 1d8 # Small Eberron shard value]]{1d8}</td><td>4.5</td></tr><tr><td>Greater</td><td>[[/r 4d4 * 10 # Greater Eberron shard value]]{4d4 × 10}</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><th scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=\"3\">Khyber Shards</th></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>[[/r 4d4 * 75 # Small Khyber shard value]]{4d4 × 75}</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td>Greater</td><td>[[/r 4d4 * 500 # Greater Khyber shard value]]{4d4 × 500}</td><td>5,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Flametouched Iron:</span>\_This substance, considered sacred by the Church of the Silver Flame, has a speckled, dark, rust-red color in its natural form. When refined, it becomes a shimmering silver hue. Flametouched iron has all of the same physical properties as normal iron except it possesses supernatural properties based on the form it takes.</p><p>A flametouched iron weapon is treated as good-aligned for purposes of extra damage to creatures with such a weakness. Flametouched iron armor grants Arcane Resistance against powers of evil outsiders. A flametouched iron holy symbol grants a +2 bonus to a cleric’s free rerolls from using their holy symbol and adds +1d6 damage when using the Destroy Undead Edge.</p><p>A flametouched iron weapon or suit of armor costs an additional +1,000 gp, and a flametouched iron holy symbol costs 750 gp.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Livewood:</span>\_When livewood trees are cut down, they remain completely alive while still being worked like normal hardwood. This allows for powers that normally affect plants to interact with livewood objects as if they were living plants. For example, a druid who can teleport from tree to tree could also teleport to livewood objects. Dryads melded inside a livewood tree could end up stuck in a livewood object.</p><p>Livewood has Hardness 6. The cost of a livewood item is +50% the cost of the same item made from normal wood.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Riedran Crysteel:</span>\_ Riedran crysteel is an alloy composed of iron and a crystalline mineral substance mined in Riedra through operations overseen by the Inspired. \_Weapons forged with crysteel resonate with psionic power, and have a +1 bonus to damage when wielded by anyone who has psionic abilities. Crysteel items have Hardness 10. Such weapons cost an additional 1,500 gp.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Soarwood:</span>\_This magically buoyant wood grows plentifully in the subcontinent of Aerenal. Soarwood is critical in the construction and operation of elemental airships and galleons. It weighs as much as air meaning it will float, but not rise. Any amount of weight added to the soarwood will cause it to fall. Water vessels made from soarwood double their speed and cost four times as much. Soarwood has the same Hardness as normal wood (Hardness 8) but weighs only 75% as much.</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Targath:</span>\_Mined on the northern coast of Argonnessen, targath is soft and often fashioned into magical items that grant health benefits. For example, just a small portion of targath carried or worn protects the possessor with a +2 bonus on Vigor rolls to resist infection from a disease.</p><p>Targath is harmful to the deathless of Aerenal. A metal weapon forged from Targath inflicts +4 additional damage to deathless beings but also suffers a −1 penalty to attack and damage rolls due to their weaker composition. Targath has Hardness 9. Its cost varies based on the type of item being crafted. Ammunition cost +3 gp, one-handed weapons cost +30 gp per damage die type, and two-handed weapons cost +200 gp.</p></section><section><h2>Armor</h2><table><caption>Armor</caption><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Armor</th><th>Min Str.</th><th>Weight</th><th>Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope=\"colgroup\" colspan=\"5\">Light</th></tr><tr><td>Leafweave</td><td>+2</td><td>d4</td><td>11</td><td>750</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><p><em>Notes:</em>\_Reduces Armor Interference penalties by 1.</p></td></tr><tr class=\"striping-offset\"></tr><tr><td>Darkleaf Breastplate</td><td>+4</td><td>d6</td><td>30</td><td>2,450</td></tr></tbody></table></section><section><h2>Melee Weapons</h2><table><caption>Melee Weapons</caption><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Damage</th><th>Min Str.</th><th>Weight</th><th>Cost</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Scimitar, Valenar Double</td><td>Str+d6</td><td>d6</td><td>15</td><td>125</td><td>Parry +1, Two Hands, can be used as if a\_weapon in each hand.</td></tr><tr><td>Sharrash, Talenta</td><td>Str+d10</td><td>d10</td><td>10</td><td>18</td><td>Reach 1, Two Hands.
