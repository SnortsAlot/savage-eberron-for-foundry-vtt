  content: "<article class=\"savage-eberron --article\"><section><h2>New Special Abilities</h2><p>Many of the Special Abilities from <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>\_and the <cite>Savage Worlds Fantasy Companion</cite>\_are applied to the creatures in this chapter. Below are some additional abilities that are specific to <cite>Eberron</cite>\_or otherwise are not presented in those books.</p><section><h3>Aberration</h3><p>Aberrations are strange and alien monstrosities, often with innate psionic abilities. They have Darkvision and are vulnerable to weapons made of byeshk.</p></section><section><h3>Blindsight</h3><p>Blindsight is the ability “see” without the sense of sight. A creature with this ability might have the ability to use echolocation, have an acute sense of smell, or feel vibrations from movement in the air or on the ground. Blindsight can render powers such as <em>invisibility</em>\_or <em>darkness</em>\_useless if the creature has a line of effect with its prey. The range of this ability varies by creature.</p><p>A creature with Blindsight also has the same benefits as All-Around Vision Special Ability, but the creature cannot distinguish color or contrast, cannot use the ability to read, is not vulnerable to gaze attacks, and cannot sense anything if in a vacuum. Blindsight renders the creature immune to the <em>blind</em>\_power, but <em>silence</em>\_negates Blindsight if the creature relies on hearing for this ability.</p></section><section><h3>Deathless</h3><p>Deathless benefit from the same characteristics as undead (see <strong>Special Abilities</strong>\_in <cite>Savage Worlds</cite>). The energy used to create and heal deathless is positive energy instead of negative energy. They are affected by negative energy just as living creatures are. Deathless are vulnerable to weapons made of targath which inflict an additional +4 damage to deathless beings.</p><section><h3>Engulf</h3><p>The creature can completely swallow or surround targets it moves over, as long as it doesn’t make any other attacks the same round. Victims who fail an Agility roll are engulfed and are subject to attacks from the creature each round on the creature’s turn. Engulfed targets are considered to be Grappled.</p></section><section><h3>Living Construct</h3><p>Living constructs are made from organic and inorganic matter and are capable of emotions and conscious thought. They lack some of the benefits of constructs, but also have some distinct advantages. Living constructs do not need to breathe, eat, or drink, and are immune to disease and poison. Living constructs also don’t need to sleep, and arcane powers can’t put them to sleep; however, they must spend at least six hours in a relaxed state. In this state, living constructs remain conscious, can see and hear as normal, and can perform simple tasks including using the Repair skill on themselves.</p><p>Living constructs cannot heal naturally, and characters using the <em>healing</em>\_power or Healing skill on them subtract 2 from the respective rolls. With a failed Vigor roll when Incapacitated, they become automatically stabilized but inert and helpless. Injuries on a living construct can only be removed when all wounds are “healed” with the Repair skill or the <em>repairing</em>\_power.</p></section></section><section><h2>Bestiary</h2><section><h3 class=\"wild-card\">Ascendant Councilor</h3><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Attributes:</span>\_Agility d10+2, Smarts d12+4, Spirit d12+5, Strength d12+6, Vigor d12+4</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Skills:</span>\_Academics d12+5, Athletics d4, Battle d12+5, Common Knowledge d12+5, Fighting d12+5, Notice d12+5, Occult d12+5, Persuasion d12+5, Research d12+5, Stealth d4</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Pace:</span>\_7; <span class=\"inline-heading\">Parry:</span>\_7; <span class=\"inline-heading\">Toughness:</span>\_14 (3)</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Edges:</span>\_Improved Arcane Resistance, Improved Counterattack, Improved First Strike, Planar Mastery</p><p><span class=\"inline-heading\">Special Abilities:</span></p><ul><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Armor +3</span></li><li><span class=\"inline-heading\">Consecrated Aura:</span>\_A field of positive energy emanates from an ascendant counselor in a 10” radius.
