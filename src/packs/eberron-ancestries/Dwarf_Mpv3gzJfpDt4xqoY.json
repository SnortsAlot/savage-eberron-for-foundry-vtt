They can see in Pitch Darkness up to 10” (20 yards), ignoring all Illumination penalties and up to 2 points of penalties from invisibility or similar powers. </p></li><li><p><strong>Reduced Pace (−1):</strong> Dwarves have short legs compared to human-sized ancestries. Decrease their Pace by 1 and their running die one die type. </p></li><li><p><strong>Stonecunning (+1):</strong> Generations of delving into the depths of the Mror Holds has taught the Dwarves how to identify unusual stonework, granting them the Stonecunning Edge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tough (+3):</strong> Dwarves are genetically stout and tough.
