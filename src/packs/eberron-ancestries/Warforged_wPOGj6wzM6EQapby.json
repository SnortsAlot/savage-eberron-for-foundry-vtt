    "description": "<ul><li><p><strong>Built for War (−1):</strong> Warforged were designed, built, and trained as tools of war. Their world knowledge off of the battlefield is limited. They do not have Common Knowledge as a core skill.</p></li><li><p><strong>Composite Plating (+2):</strong> A warforged is covered in tough plating made of magically-treated woods and metals. Warforged gain +4 Armor. The composite plating is considered light armor. Warforged are unable to wear additional armor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Living Construct (+4):</strong></p><ul><li><p>Doesn’t breathe (+2), doesn’t eat or drink (+1), immune to poison and disease (+2).</p></li><li><p>Doesn’t sleep (+2), and powers can’t put them to sleep.</p></li><li><p>Cannot heal naturally, and using the Healing skill or casting healing on a warforged has a −2 penalty. Wounds can be removed with the Repair skill, which takes one hour per Wound per attempt and is not limited to the “Golden Hour,” or by casting repairing. (−2)</p></li><li><p>With a failed Vigor roll when Incapacitated, becomes automatically stabilized but inert and helpless. (+0)</p></li><li><p>Injuries on warforged can only be removed when all Wounds are “healed” with the Repair skill or the repairing power. (−1)</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Outsider (−2):</strong> Warforged have the Outsider (Major) Hindrance. With a long history of being dedicated soldiers of war, warforged have difficulty blending into post-war Khorvaire. Most non-warforged strongly dislike the sight of warforged as they stand as living reminders of the horror that was the Last War. As such, warforged have −2 to Persuasion rolls when interacting with non-warforged and are often treated as less than human.</p></li><li><p><strong>Steel Fists (+1):</strong> Warforged may attack with their fists as natural weapons that deal Str+d4 damage.</p></li></ul>",
