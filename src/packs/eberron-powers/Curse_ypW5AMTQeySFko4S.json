    "description": "<p>Some practitioners of the arcane arts heal their allies. Others inflict sickness upon their enemies. To use this particularly nasty spell, the caster makes an arcane skill roll opposed by the victim's Spirit roll. Failure means the victim suffers a level of Fatigue immediately and at sunset each day thereafter (further castings of curse have no additional effect).</p><p>The Fatigue cannot be recovered until the <em>curse</em> is lifted, and once the accursed becomes Incapacitated, he makes a Vigor roll each day to avoid death.</p><p>A caster may not attempt to curse an individual more than once per day.</p><p><strong>Breaking the Curse:</strong> The <em>curse</em> can be lifted by the original caster at will, and ends automatically if she's slain. <em>Dispel</em> also removes a <em>curse</em> (at -2), though each individual may only try once-if failed it's beyond her abilities.</p><div><p><strong>Modifiers</strong></p></div><ul><li class=\"epic-power-icon\"><strong>Alternate Effect (+2):</strong> Instead of becoming Fatigued, the caster might give the victim a Minor Hindrance instead (or a Major Hindrance with a raise on the casting roll). She might make the character Ugly, for example, or unable to swim (Can't Swim), or Clumsy. Physical curses, such as One Arm, may simply mean the victim's arm is sore, strained, or otherwise useless rather than actually missing.</li><li class=\"epic-power-icon\"><strong>Turn to Stone (+5):</strong> The accursed must make a Spirit roll every round or take a level of Fatigue. When Incapacitated, the victim turns to stone (his Toughness becomes Hardness). The curse must be broken to stop the effect (see above).</li></ul>",
