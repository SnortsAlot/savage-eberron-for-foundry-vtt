    "description": "<p><em>Repairing</em> fixes damage to objects, including constructs and living constructs, that have taken damage but are not entirely broken or destroyed.</p><p>For a Wild Card, each use of <em>repairing</em> removes a Wound with a success, two with a raise. The power may be cast additional times to remove additional Wounds.</p><p>For Extras or objects, the Prophesier must first determine if the construct or object is already destroyed. If so, no repair may be attempted. Otherwise, a successful arcane skill roll repairs the construct or object.</p><p>If the target is a living construct that was inert, a successful <em>repairing</em> revives them.</p><p><strong>Modifiers</strong></p><ul><li class=\"savage-eberron--epic-modifier\"><p><strong>Greater Repairing (+10):</strong> <em>Greater repairing</em> can rebuild objects that are completely broken but only if all parts are still available. This spell may also be used to restore constructs (but not living constructs) that have perished.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crippling Injuries (+15):</strong> For living constructs, the power can repair a permanent Crippling Injury (see <strong>Incapacitation</strong> in <em>Savage Worlds</em>). This requires an hour of preparation and only one casting is permitted per injury. If it fails, this caster cannot repair that particular injury (but someone else may try). If successful, the subject is Exhausted for 24 hours.</p></li></ul>",
