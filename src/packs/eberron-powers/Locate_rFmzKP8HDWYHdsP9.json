If the caster has never seen the target, the roll is at -2. A success gives a sense of the general direction and distance of the target. A raise also gives an impression of the target (e.g., the creature is asleep, the object is in a strongbox, the secret door is behind a bookshelf).</p><p><strong>Running Water:</strong> Running water blocks <em>locate</em> if it's in the path between the caster and the target.</p><div><p><strong>Modifiers</strong></p></div><ul><li class=\"savage-eberron--epic-modifier\"><strong>Discern Location (+2):</strong> The caster can learn the exact location of the creature or object, and running water does not block the power.</li><li><strong>Find the Path (+1):</strong> In addition to the direction and distance to a target, the caster also has a supernatural sense of the best or fastest way to navigate to its general area.</li></ul></article>",
