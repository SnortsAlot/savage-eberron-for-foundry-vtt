    "description": "<p>Adventurers sometimes take time to create useful items. Creating an item requires appropriate raw materials costing half the item’s market value and appropriate tools. Making something is usually resolved as an extended skill check, with each skill roll representing roughly a day’s work, though this may be smaller for particularly simple jobs.</p><p>The number of successes required and modifiers depend on the complexity, size, and cost of the item to be created, as well as the availability of necessary resources and tools, as determined by the Prophesier. A critical failure on a skill roll means the work has been ruined and the raw materials wasted. </p><p></p>",
