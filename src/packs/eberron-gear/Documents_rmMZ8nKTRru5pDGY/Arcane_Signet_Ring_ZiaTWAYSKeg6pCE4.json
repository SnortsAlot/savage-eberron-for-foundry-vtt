These rings are set with large gemstones that contain an intricate runic pattern—actually an arcane mark—that becomes visible when worn by the person for whom it was constructed. It is extremely unusual for anyone who does not have the Aristocrat Edge as a member of a dragonmarked house to wear an arcane signet ring.</p>",
