  <article class="swade-core">

  <p>Champions are holy (or unholy) men and women chosen to fight for a
  particular deity or religion. Most are pious souls ready and willing to lay
  down their lives for a greater cause, but some may have been born into the
  role and follow their path with some reluctance.</p>

  <p>Champions fight the forces of darkness (or good), adding +2 damage when
  attacking supernaturally evil (or good if they’re evil) creatures. The bonus
  applies to
  @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03areaeffectat00]{area
  effect damage},
  @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03attacks0000000]{ranged
  attacks},
  @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor05powers.JournalEntryPage.05powers00000000]{powers},
  etc.</p>

  <p>The GM must decide which foes this bonus applies to, but generally it’s any
  evil (or good!) creature born of magic or with any supernatural abilities.</p>
