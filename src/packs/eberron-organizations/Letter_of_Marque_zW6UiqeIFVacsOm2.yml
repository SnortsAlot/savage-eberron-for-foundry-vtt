    <p>The concept of letters of marque originated during the Last War, when the
    rulers of the warring nations granted adventurers permission to attack ships
    and assets belonging to other nations. The Treaty of Thronehold declared
    void all letters of marque that existed at the time, but the idea survives
    in Breland, though in a rather altered form. The king of Breland now issues
    papers granting adventurers permission to explore and plunder the ruins of
    Xen’drik. Though such permission is not technically necessary, wise
    adventurers are sure to secure it before using Sharn as a launching point
    for expeditions to Xen’drik. Those who try to sell treasures from Xen’drik
    on the open market in Breland must produce a letter of marque or face stiff
    fines—on top of forfeiting the treasure they won on their adventures.</p>
