    <article class="swadefc"><p>
        This power grants basic control over the four traditional elements: air, earth, fire, and water (the elements may
        vary for other cultures).
      </p>
    <p>Upon activation, the caster may choose one of the following effects:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>

    <strong>Attack:</strong> The caster uses their activation roll as an attack
    roll, dealing 2d4 damage to a target
          (3d4 with a raise) within Range.
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Move:</strong> The caster may move a cubic foot of air, earth (half
    that in stone), fire, or water up to
          the caster's Smarts in any direction as a limited action.
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Push:</strong> The elements buffet and move the target. The caster
    uses his activation roll in place of
          his Strength for a Push (see <em>@UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.JournalEntry.swadecor00introd.JournalEntryPage.00introduction00]{Savage Worlds}</em>).
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Special Effects:</strong> The caster may use the elements to create
    an additional effect with the GM's
          approval. Some examples are using air to blow out a torch, fan a flame, or cool someone down (reroll a Fatigue
          roll in oppressive heat). The caster may use earth to cover tracks, fix breaks in stone or earthen walls, or use
          fire to conjure flame about the size of a torch or spread existing flame (see
          Fire). He may use water to conjure a quart of water (not “inside” objects or
          people) or purify a gallon of water per casting.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        After activation, each additional use of the effects above are an action. Roll a new arcane skill roll for Attack or
        Push (these rolls do not suffer Backlash for @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.JournalEntry.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03rules000000000]{Critical Failures} as they are not activation rolls).
      </p>
    <div><strong>Modifiers</strong></div>

    <ul>

    <li class="epic-power-icon">

    <strong>Power (+3):</strong> The volume of air, earth, fire, or water
    affected is tripled, the target of Push
          suffers a -2 penalty to resist, and the damage of Attack is increased to 2d6 (3d6 on a raise).
        </li>
    <li class="epic-power-icon">

    <strong>Weather (+5):</strong> The caster can summon or dispel storms, bring
    a cooling rain, scorch the earth with
          a heatwave, or even bring snow to the hottest climes.
          <p>
            The caster can bring or disperse rain, snow, sun, and wind in about a five-mile radius. The severity depends on
            the local environment-a harsh desert might receive gentle rain while a rain forest gets a driving downpour. The
            effects take 10 minutes to create and last an hour.
          </p>
