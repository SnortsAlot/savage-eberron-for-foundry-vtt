    <p><em>Repairing</em> fixes damage to objects, including constructs and
    living constructs, that have taken damage but are not entirely broken or
    destroyed.</p><p>For a Wild Card, each use of <em>repairing</em> removes a
    Wound with a success, two with a raise. The power may be cast additional
    times to remove additional Wounds.</p><p>For Extras or objects, the
    Prophesier must first determine if the construct or object is already
    destroyed. If so, no repair may be attempted. Otherwise, a successful arcane
    skill roll repairs the construct or object.</p><p>If the target is a living
    construct that was inert, a successful <em>repairing</em> revives
    them.</p><p><strong>Modifiers</strong></p><ul><li
    class="savage-eberron--epic-modifier"><p><strong>Greater Repairing
    (+10):</strong> <em>Greater repairing</em> can rebuild objects that are
    completely broken but only if all parts are still available. This spell may
    also be used to restore constructs (but not living constructs) that have
    perished.</p></li><li><p><strong>Crippling Injuries (+15):</strong> For
    living constructs, the power can repair a permanent Crippling Injury (see
    <strong>Incapacitation</strong> in <em>Savage Worlds</em>). This requires an
    hour of preparation and only one casting is permitted per injury. If it
    fails, this caster cannot repair that particular injury (but someone else
    may try). If successful, the subject is Exhausted for 24
    hours.</p></li></ul>
