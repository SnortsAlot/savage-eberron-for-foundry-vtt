    <em>Detect arcana</em> allows the recipient of the power to see and detect
    all supernatural persons, objects, or
        effects in sight for five rounds. This includes <em>invisible</em> foes, enchantments on people or items, and so on.
        With a raise, the caster knows the type of enchantment as well.
      </p>
    <p>
        When used on a supernatural creature, the caster learns its active powers and arcane abilities. With a raise, he
        knows Weaknesses common to that creature type. This doesn't reveal Weaknesses of unique individuals, if any. Those
        must usually be discovered through research or trial and error.
      </p>
    <p>

    <strong>Invisible Creatures:</strong> <em>Detect arcana</em> also allows a
    character to ignore up to 4 points of
        penalties when attacking foes hidden by magical darkness, invisibility, or similar abilities (or all penalties with
        a raise).
      </p>
    <p>

    <em>Conceal arcana</em> obscures one being or item of Normal Scale or
    smaller from the detect magic ability for one
        hour (see Detect Magic and the@UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.JournalEntry.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03sizeandscale00]{Size} Table in <em>@UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.JournalEntry.swadecor00introd.JournalEntryPage.00introduction00]{Savage Worlds}</em>). For larger creatures, increase the cost by the Scale modifier (+2 PPs for Large, +4 PPs for Huge, or +6 PPs for
        Gargantuan).
      </p>
    <p>
        With a success, attempts to <em>detect arcana </em>on the being or item suffer a -2 penalty or -4 with a raise. If
        <em>detect arcana</em> fails, the character cannot see through the ruse with this casting and is not aware it is
        concealed unless presented with obvious evidence of such (for example, the attack of an invisible foe).

    <ul>

    <li>

    <strong>Additional Recipients (+1):</strong> The power may affect more than
    one viewer for <em>detect</em>, or
          item for <em>conceal</em>, for 1 additional Power Point each.
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Alignment Sense (+1):</strong> The caster can sense the presence and
    exact location of supernatural good
          or evil within range. <em>Detect arcana</em> activated with Alignment Sense no longer requires line of sight to
          locate creatures.
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Area of Effect (+1/+2):</strong> <em>Conceal</em> only. The power
    affects everything in a sphere the size
          of a Medium Blast Template for +1 points, or a Large Blast Template for +2.
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Identify (+1):</strong> The caster can identify a magic item's
    powers and how they work. Success reveals
          its powers and how they work, but only a raise reveals any cursed powers.
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Strong (+1):</strong> <em>Conceal</em> only. <em>Detection</em>
    rolls to see through the concealment are
          made at -2. This stacks with the additional penalty for casting with a raise.
