    <p>Persuasion is the ability to convince others to do what you want through
    reason, cajoling, deception, rewards, or other friendly means. Persuasion
    isn’t mind control. It can change someone’s attitude but not their goals. A
    bandit may let you keep a sentimental piece of jewelry with a good
    Persuasion roll but still takes all your other goods.</p>

    <p>When used to
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03support0000000]{Support}
    allies it’s an unopposed roll. If the target is resistant, it’s an
    @JournalEntry[JBxsGv2wAoAmoCDe]{opposed} roll vs. the target’s
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01traits00000000]{Spirit}.
    The GM should modify the roll as she sees fit based on roleplaying, any
    pertinent
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01edges000000000]{Edges}
    or
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01hindrances0000]{Hindrances}
    that affect the conversation, and the circumstances.</p>

    <p><strong>Reaction Level:</strong> How much a person is willing to
    cooperate depends largely on their attitude toward whoever’s talking to
    them. The Game Master can decide how nonplayer characters feel based on the
    setting, or roll on the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-tables.Reaction
    Table]{Reaction Table} if she has no preconceived notions.</p>

    <p>@UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03traitrolls0000]{Success}
    improves the target’s attitude one level and a raise improves it two.
    Further increases aren’t generally possible in the same encounter—it takes
    individuals a little time to adjust their biases.</p>

    <p>@UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03traitrolls0000]{Failure}
    means the target won’t change his mind this scene or until the situation
    changes in some important way. A
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03traitrolls0000]{Critical
    Failure} also <em>reduces</em> the target’s attitude two levels.</p>

    <p>Only one roll should generally be allowed per interaction unless new
    information is revealed, a substantial reward is offered, etc.</p>

    <p><strong>Networking: </strong>Characters can also use Persuasion as a
    “macro skill,” simulating a few hours or an evening’s time hobnobbing and
    socializing to gain favors or information. See
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor04theadv.JournalEntryPage.04networking0000]{Networking}.</p>
