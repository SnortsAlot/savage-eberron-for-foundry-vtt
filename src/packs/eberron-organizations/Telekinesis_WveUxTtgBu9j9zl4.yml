    <em>Telekinesis</em> is the ability to move objects or creatures (including
    oneself) with arcane will. It has a
        Strength of d10, or d12 with a raise. On activation, the caster may immediately perform one of the “uses” below.
        Subsequent uses are actions and use the arcane skill (but are not activation rolls and therefore not subject to
        Backlash from @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.JournalEntry.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03rules000000000]{Critical Failures}).
      </p>
    <p>
        Unwilling beings targeted by telekinesis resist the caster's arcane skill with an opposed Spirit roll when first
        targeted, and at the start of each of their turns thereafter until they're released. Successful resistance does not
        mean the spell fails-the caster may try again on his next turn.
      </p>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong></p>

    <ul>

    <li><strong>Bash:</strong> The target may be bashed into the floor, ceiling,
    or walls for Str+d6 damage.</li>

    <li>

    <strong>Change Targets:</strong> The caster may release a victim or tool as
    a free action. Picking up a new weapon
          is a free action. Selecting a new unwilling target is an action and is resisted as above.
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Manipulate:</strong> The caster may use tools to perform simple
    tasks or wield a weapon, using the
          caster's arcane skill. (This doesn't alter the caster's Parry if wielding a weapon if his arcane skill is
          different from his Fighting skill.)
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Move:</strong> The target or tool may be moved up to the caster's
    Smarts as a
          limited free action.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Power (+3):</strong> The Strength of <em>telekinesis</em> is d12, or
    d12+2 with a raise. Bashing victims
          inflicts Str+d8 damage. Objects weighing 500 pounds or more are treated as Heavy Weapons.
