    <section class="description">
    <p>
     The spellcaster is so well-versed in her arcane or divine craft that she has learned new ways to manipulate her
     powers. She gains access to the Epic Power Modifiers for all her powers.
     </p>
    <p>
     Epic Mastery applies to all a hero's Arcane Backgrounds if she has more than one, though she must meet the
     arcane skill requirement for each before she can use Epic Power Modifiers with that background's powers.
     </p>
    <p>See Chapter Four for a complete list of Epic Power Modifiers.</p>
