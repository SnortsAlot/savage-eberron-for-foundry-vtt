    <p>Your heroine is connected to people or organizations who can help her
    when the chips are down. It might be the mob, the Feds, a union, or even
    other adventurers.<br />Connections may be taken more than once, selecting a
    new faction or contact each time. Once per session, and assuming she can get
    in touch with them, the heroine can call on her friends for a favor. <br

    contact (GM&rsquo;s call), but might include a loan, gear, a few allied
    fighters, transportation, information, or even a professional with critical
    skills the party doesn&rsquo;t have, like a hacker or scholar.</p>
