    <article class="swadefc"><p>Sanctuary protects the caster against area
    effect attacks, Tests, powers, and even ranged attacks that would affect
    her. Any evil creature that attempts to directly target the caster or
    recipient in
        a negative way must make a Spirit roll as a free action (at -2 if cast with a raise). If the roll fails, the attempt
        fails and the creature loses that action.
      </p>
    <p>
        Sanctuary works both ways, however. If anyone under the effects of the power attempts to harm another creature (evil
        or otherwise), the power instantly terminates for everyone.
      </p>
    <p>
        Sanctuary trumps any ward the caster may be holding or protected by. If the creature overcomes the sanctuary spell,
        it ignores any wards that turn as well.
