    <p>This fortunate individual is very wealthy. He has five times the
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01characters0000]{starting
    funds} for the setting during character creation and, if appropriate, a
    yearly income after responsibilities of around $500,000. </p>

    <p>Even wealthier characters may exist, but unless there&rsquo;s a game
    effect it probably shouldn&rsquo;t matter. This should be worked out with
    the GM and come with many more assets as well as onerous
    responsibilities</p>
