    <p>Champions are holy (or unholy) men and women chosen to fight for a
    particular deity or religion. Most are pious souls ready and willing to lay
    down their lives for a greater cause, but some may have been born into the
    role and follow their path with some reluctance.</p>

    <p>Champions fight the forces of darkness (or good), adding +2 damage when
    attacking supernaturally evil (or good if they’re evil) creatures. The bonus
    applies to
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03areaeffectat00]{area
    effect damage},
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor03rules0.JournalEntryPage.03attacks0000000]{ranged
    attacks},
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor05powers.JournalEntryPage.05powers00000000]{powers},
    etc.</p>

    <p>The GM must decide which foes this bonus applies to, but generally it’s
    any evil (or good!) creature born of magic or with any supernatural
    abilities.</p>
