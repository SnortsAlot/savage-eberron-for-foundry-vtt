    <p>(MINOR OR MAJOR)</p>

    <p>Your hero has a responsibility she must attend to on a daily or regular
    basis. It could be a job, volunteer work, taking care of family or friends,
    etc.</p>

    <p>The Obligation consumes about 20 hours most weeks, or 40 + for the
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01characters0000]{Major}
    version. Exactly what that entails should be discussed between the player
    and the Game Master.</p>
