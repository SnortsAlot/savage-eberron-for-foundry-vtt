    <ul><li><p><strong>Darkvision (+1):</strong> Dwarven eyes are accustomed to
    the dark of the underearth. They can see in Pitch Darkness up to 10” (20
    yards), ignoring all Illumination penalties and up to 2 points of penalties
    from invisibility or similar powers. </p></li><li><p><strong>Reduced Pace
    (−1):</strong> Dwarves have short legs compared to human-sized ancestries.
    Decrease their Pace by 1 and their running die one die type.
    </p></li><li><p><strong>Stonecunning (+1):</strong> Generations of delving
    into the depths of the Mror Holds has taught the Dwarves how to identify
    unusual stonework, granting them the Stonecunning
    Edge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tough (+3):</strong> Dwarves are genetically
    stout and tough. They start with a d6 in Vigor instead of a d4. This
    increases their maximum Vigor to d12+1. They also have a +1 bonus to resist
    poisons, powers, and supernatural abilities that behave similarly to
    powers.</p></li></ul>
