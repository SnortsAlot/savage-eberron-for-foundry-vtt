    <em>Healing</em> removes Wounds less than an hour old. A success removes one
    Wound, and a raise removes two. The
        power may be cast additional times to remove
      </p>
    <p>additional Wounds within that hour and as long as the healer has enough
    Power Points.</p>

    <p>
        For Extras, the GM must first determine if the ally is still alive (see <strong>Aftermath</strong> in
        <em>@UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.JournalEntry.swadecor00introd.JournalEntryPage.00introduction00]{Savage Worlds}</em>). If so, a successful arcane skill roll returns the ally to action (Shaken if it matters.)
      </p>
    <div><strong>Modifiers</strong></div>

    <ul>

    <li>

    <strong>Greater Healing (+10):</strong> <em>Greater healing</em> can restore
    any Wound, including those more than
          an hour old.
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Crippling Injuries (+20):</strong> The power can heal a permanent
    Crippling Injury. This requires an hour
          of preparation and only one casting is permitted per injury. If it fails, this caster cannot <em>heal</em> that
          particular injury (but someone else may try). If successful, the subject is Exhausted for 24 hours.
        </li>
    <li class="epic-power-icon">

    <strong>Mass Healing (+2/+3):</strong> For +2 Power Points, <em>healing</em>
    affects all allies within a Medium
          Blast Template centered on the caster (or a Large Blast Template for +3).
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Neutralize Poison or Disease (+1):</strong> A successful
    <em>healing</em> roll negates any poison or
          disease. If the poison or disease has a bonus or penalty associated with it, the modifier applies to the arcane
          skill roll as well.
