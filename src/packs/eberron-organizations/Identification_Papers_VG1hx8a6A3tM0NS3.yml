  description: >-
    <p>Most people of the middle and upper classes, at least in the most
    civilized areas of Khorvaire (Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, Zilargo,
    and the Mror Holds) carry identification papers with them at all times.
    Issued by national governments and notarized by House Sivis, these papers
    present a detailed physical description of a person (the wealthy sometimes
    commission small portraits of themselves), the person’s name and residence,
    and in some cases additional information about the person’s affiliations
    (particularly including any connection to a dragonmarked house, royalty, or
    a large institution).</p>
