    <article class="swadefc"><h3>Destroy Undead</h3>
    <p>
     The undead are abominations to good clerics. The dead have passed on to their just rewards and should not return
     to the land of the living. It is little wonder then that these holy men and women are so often called to stand
     against the raging hordes of the undead.
     </p>
    <p>
     Evil clerics can also destroy those undead creatures that stand in their path. Perhaps it is their affinity with
     unnatural things, or perhaps their deity simply grants the power to clear their servants' path to greater mayhem.
     </p>
    <p>
     As a limited action, the champion spends one Power Point to channel positive energy in a Large Blast Template
     centered on herself. Every undead creature within the template automatically takes 2d6 damage (or 3d6 damage for
     two Power Points).
