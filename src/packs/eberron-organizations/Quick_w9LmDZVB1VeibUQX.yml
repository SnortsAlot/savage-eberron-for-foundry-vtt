  <p>Quick characters have lightning-fast reflexes and a cool head. Whenever you
  are dealt an @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-rules.Action Cards
  (Initiative)]{Action Card} of Five or lower, you may discard it and draw again
  until you get a card higher than Five.</p>

  <p>@UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-rules.swadecor01charac.JournalEntryPage.01characters0000]{Characters}
  with both the @Compendium[swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Level Headed]{Level
  Headed} and Quick Edges first draw their additional card and choose which to
  take. If that card is a Five or less, the Quick Edge may be used to draw a
  replacement until itâ€™s Six or higher.</p>
