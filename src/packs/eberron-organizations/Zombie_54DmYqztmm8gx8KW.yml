    <article class="swadefc"><p>
      <em>Zombie</em> grants animation and basic intelligence to the remains of a once-living being. The summoned horror
        is obedient but literal-minded in its duties. It isn't telepathic, and must be controlled by voice.
      </p>
    <p>
        The being has the physical skills it had in life, but its Smarts, Spirit, and related skills are reset to d4. A
        raise on the casting roll increases any one of their Traits one die type (caster's choice).
      </p>
    <p>
        See Savage Worlds for the standard profile of a human zombie. Corpses aren't summoned by this ability, so there must
        actually be a supply of bodies in Range (GM's call).
      </p>
    <p>An undead Incapacitated by damage can't be raised with this power
    again.</p>

    <div><strong>Modifiers</strong></div>

    <ul>

    <li>

    <strong>Additional Zombies (+1):</strong> A larger horde can be raised in a
    single casting by paying an additional
          1 Power Point for each extra <em>zombie</em> raised.
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Armed &amp; Armored (+1 per Zombie):</strong> The dead rise with +2
    armor and weapons common to their
          background or environment. Choose one:
          <ul>
    <li><strong>Hand Weapon:</strong> Str+d6.</li>

    <li><strong>Ranged Weapon:</strong> Range 12/24/48, Damage 2d6.</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>

    <strong>Mind Rider (+1):</strong> The caster can communicate and sense
    through one of the undead he's conjured in
          this casting.
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Permanent (0):</strong> The <em>zombie</em> is given unlife until
    Incapacitated by Wounds. The Power
          Points used to raise it are “invested” and unavailable until it's destroyed. The necromancer may terminate his
          creations' unlife at any time, regardless of sight, distance, or other factors. His Power Points then begin
          recharging normally.
          <p>Permanent zombies remain animated even if their creator is slain!</p>
    </li>

    <li>

    <strong>Skeletal (+1 per Zombie):</strong> The corpse sloughs off the anchor
    of dead flesh and rises as a
          skeleton. Use the skeleton profile instead of the zombie.
        </li>
