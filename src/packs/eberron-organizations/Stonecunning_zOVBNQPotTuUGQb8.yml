    <p>
     Those who spend their lives around worked stone quickly perceive imperfections or alterations within its design.
     Assuming they can see or feel the work, they get one free Notice roll at +2 to detect traps, hidden doors, or
     compartments in stonework within 10 feet of their person. Success means they know some alteration has been made,
     and a raise gives them insight into its general purpose.
