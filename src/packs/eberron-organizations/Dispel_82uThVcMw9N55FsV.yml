    <em>Dispel</em> allows a hero to negate enemy powers. It has no effect on
    permanent enchantments or natural
        abilities such as a dragon's breath or a banshee's scream. <em>Dispel</em> affects arcane devices
        normally (see @UUID[Compendium.swade-fantasy-companion.swade-fc.JournalEntry.swadefcp04arcana.JournalEntryPage.04arcanedevice00]{Arcane Devices}).
      </p>
    <p>

    <em>Dispel</em> can be used on a power already in effect or to counter an
    enemy power as it's being used. The latter
        requires the countering mage to be on Hold and interrupt his foe's action.
      </p>
    <p>
        In either case, <em>dispelling</em> an opponent's power is an opposed roll of arcane skills. A target using the
        @UUID[Compendium.swade-fc.swade-fc-edges.soteS5FmYSne0LhQ]{Mystic Powers} Edge or @UUID[Compendium.swade-fantasy-companion.swade-fc.swadefcp06bestia.JournalEntryPage.06newspecialab00#innate-powers]{innate powers} uses Spirit as its arcane skill.
      </p>
    <p>
        If the <em>dispelling</em> character wins, the targeted power ends immediately (or fails if it was countered with
        the usual results of failure). With a raise, the caster may make the recipient of the <em>dispelled</em> power Distracted.

    <div><strong>Modifiers</strong></div>

    <ul>

    <li class="epic-power-icon">

    <strong>Anti-Magic Field (+8):</strong> Instead of affecting a power at
    Range, this modifier creates a Medium
          Blast Template centered on the recipient with a Duration of 5. Magic items, effects, and powers have no effect
          within the field. Summoned creatures in the field must make a Spirit roll each round or take a Wound.
          Magically-created objects are unaffected. Anti-Magic Field has no effect on deities or artifacts, and can't be
          combined with any other modifiers.
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Area of Effect (+1/+2/+3):</strong> The effect covers an area: +1
    Power Point uses a Small Blast Template,
          +2 PPs uses Medium, or +3 uses Large. The caster makes one arcane skill roll and chooses which power on each
          target is affected. The caster of the affected power opposes with arcane skill. This affects all targets in the
          area unless the Selective modifier is used.
        </li>
    <li class="epic-power-icon">

    <strong>Disenchant (+1):</strong> The caster can target a magical item
    rather than an individual or a power. This
          is a standard arcane skill roll, not an opposed roll (the GM may apply a penalty to disenchant powerful items or
          artifacts). If successful, all the item's magical abilities are negated for one round, or two with a raise.
        </li>
    <li>

    <strong>Multiple Powers (+3):</strong> If successful, the caster
    <em>dispels</em> all the target's currently
          activated powers.
        </li>
