    <p>Through meditation and training, the psion has learned to open her mind
    to manifest more powers than most are normally capable of mastering.
    Whenever she takes the
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-core-rules.swade-edges.Item.IoAJtiObDgf46BQE]{New
    Powers} Edge, she learns three powers instead of two. She also immediately
    learns one new power when taking this Edge.</p><p></p>
