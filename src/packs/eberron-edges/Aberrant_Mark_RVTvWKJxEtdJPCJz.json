    "description": "<p>The adventurer bears an aberrant dragonmark, descended from mixed (or “corrupted”) bloodlines of two or more dragonmarked lineages.</p><p>Characters with this Edge either have the Outsider (Minor) Hindrance if the mark is visible or known or the Secret (Minor) Hindrance if the mark is hidden and unknown. They do not gain additional points for Traits and Edges from the Hindrance.</p><p>The dragonmark grants a single power granted by the mark regardless of its Rank requirement. The aberrant mark also grants a +1 bonus to Intimidation rolls against anyone who sees or knows of the bearer’s aberrant mark and doesn’t bear an aberrant mark of their own.</p><p>An aberrant mark doesn’t grant access to Edges that require an Arcane Background except for the Power Points and Soul Drain Edges. If the adventurer also has an Arcane Background, none of its Edges or abilities can be used with the dragonmark powers and vice versa.</p><p>The adventurer has 15 Power Points—dedicated to the use of their mark—that recharge normally. As a limited free action, the adventurer automatically activates the power with success for its regular cost. For 2 additional Power Points, the power can be activated with a raise. He may use applicable Power Modifiers if desired (at the usual cost).</p><p>Each time the adventurer selects the Power Points Edge for their aberrant mark, her mark changes into a larger, more complex pattern and increases in power.</p><p><strong>Powers:</strong> <em>Blast, blind, bolt, lower Trait, burrow </em>(self only)<em>, burst, confusion, curse, damage field </em>(self only)<em>, drain Power Points, elemental manipulation</em> (fire only)<em>, entangle, fear, havoc, mind wipe, puppet, slow, smite, stun, summon ally, summon demon, telekinesis, zombie.</em></p><p></p>",
