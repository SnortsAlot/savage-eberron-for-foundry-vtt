  description: >-
    <p>As presented in the <em>Fantasy Companion</em>, but if a wizard has the
    @UUID[Compendium.swade-fantasy-companion.swade-fc-edges.Item.cDR3VyvEY8JcE8cg]{Spellbooks}
    Edge, he becomes dependent on it as the increased collection of powers
    becomes too vast to recall independently. If the wizard loses his spellbook,
    he can no longer cast powers if he has not recovered it by the next sunset
    or sunrise, whichever comes first.</p><p>After accessing his stored
    collection of notes, scrolls, tomes, and other arcane writings, a wizard may
    replace a lost spellbook with a week of work and 500 gp.</p><p></p>
