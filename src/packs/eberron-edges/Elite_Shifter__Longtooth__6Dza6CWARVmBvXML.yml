    <p>Either inherently or through conditioning, the shifter’s ability is
    enhanced beyond its normal abilities. All abilities are in effect only while
    shifting.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Beasthide:</strong> The shifter gains +2
    Toughness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cliffwalk:</strong> The shifter gets a
    free reroll on Athletics (climbing)
    rolls.</p></li><li><p><strong>Longstride:</strong> The shifter’s Pace
    increases by an additional +2, and her running die increases by another die
    type.</p></li><li><p><strong>Longtooth:</strong> Wounds dealt by the
    shifter’s bite attacks bleed copiously. Whenever the shifter makes a
    successful damage roll from a bite attack, she adds +4 to the
    damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Razorclaw:</strong> If the shifter can charge
    at least 6” before attacking a target with her claws, she can make two claw
    attacks at the end of the charge. The shifter also adds +4 to damage rolls
    for each claw attack.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wildhunt:</strong> Non-visual
    senses improve to such a degree that the shifter’s Notice skill increases by
    one die size. This increase applies to non-visual senses
    only.</p></li></ul><p>Shifters with the Extra Shifter Ability Edge may take
    this Edge a second time to enhance the second trait.</p><p></p>
