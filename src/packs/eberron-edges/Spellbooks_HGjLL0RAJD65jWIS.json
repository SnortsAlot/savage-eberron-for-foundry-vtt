If the wizard loses his spellbook, he can no longer cast powers if he has not recovered it by the next sunset or sunrise, whichever comes first.</p><p>After accessing his stored collection of notes, scrolls, tomes, and other arcane writings, a wizard may replace a lost spellbook with a week of work and 500 gp.</p><p></p>",
