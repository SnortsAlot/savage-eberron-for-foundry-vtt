    <p>The devout faith of some followers of the Silver Flame is strong enough
    to summon its essence when needed. When a cleric with this Edge activates
    the
    <em>@UUID[Compendium.swade-fantasy-companion.swade-fc-powers.Item.8r70sKYB6GfzzapQ]{smite}</em>
    power on a weapon, the weapon becomes engulfed in a silvery flame that does
    not burn. When the weapon strikes an evil creature, it deals an additional
    [[/r 1d6x]] damage. This flame has no effect on non-evil creatures.</p>
