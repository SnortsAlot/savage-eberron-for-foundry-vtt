    @UUID[Compendium.savage-eberron.eberron-abilities.Item.Q7vEwImap0FspKU7]{mind
    blade} has the potential to cut deep into the victim’s psyche. The soulknife
    adds
    <em>@UUID[Compendium.savage-eberron.eberron-powers.Item.CfscQ3htdj1OA6Zh]{lower
    Trait}</em> (Smarts and Spirit only) to his list of known powers. The Range
    of the power is Touch only and delivered through his mind blade with a
    successful attack or touch attack. The soulknife benefits from these
    limitations as usual. Activating lower Trait on a mind blade is a limited
    free action.</p><p>The mind blade is then “charged” with the power until the
    next successful attack or touch attack. If the attack misses, the charge
    continues to hold for the remainder of the encounter or until it is
    dismissed. If the mind blade is broken or dismissed before the power is
    delivered, the charge is lost.</p><p></p>
